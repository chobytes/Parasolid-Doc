<p>The Parasolid library is supplied with a comprehensive set of documentation, 
  in both HTML format (for online browsing) and <a HREF="pdf_index.html">PDF format</a> (so that you can print out any part of the documentation easily). The HTML version 
  that you are currently looking at contains extensive links that make it easy 
  to navigate to the relevant information, as well as a full text search feature.</p>
<p>The Parasolid documentation set consists of the following manuals:</p>
<p><b><a HREF="wn_index.html">What's New in Parasolid</a>:</b> For existing customers, 
  a guide to the new features in the latest version of Parasolid. As well as describing 
  functional enhancements to Parasolid, this guide contains a complete listing 
  of all new and updated interfaces in the API.</p>
<p><b><a href="ov_index.html">Overview of Parasolid:</a></b> Adetailed overview 
  of the functionality available in Parasolid. If you are new to Parasolid and 
  want to find out what it can do, then this manual will tell you. The Parasolid 
  Overview does not describe any technical details about how you write Parasolid 
  code.</p>
<p><b><a href="in_index.html">Installation Notes</a>:</b> A guide to installing Parasolid on your system, together with build details such as compiler settings for each of the platforms it supports. </p>
<p><b><a HREF="fd_index.html">Functional Description</a>:</b> A comprehensive 
  guide to the functionality provided by the Parasolid library. This manual should 
  be your first stop when you want to learn about how to use any aspect of the 
  functionality provided by Parasolid.</p>
<p><b><a HREF="pk_index.html">PK Reference</a>:</b> A complete reference to every 
  function, structure, and token available in the Parasolid API. This manual is the ultimate Parasolid programmer's reference. (Only available in HTML)</p>
<p><b><a HREF="di_index.html">Downward Interfaces</a>:</b> A guide to the Parasolid 
  Downward Interfaces. These modules form part of your application and control 
  all interaction between Parasolid and the operating system, handling tasks such 
  as file and memory management. </p>
<p><b><a HREF="kd_index.html">Kernel Interface Driver</a>:</b> The Kernel Interface 
  Driver (KID) is a platform-independent application available with Parasolid 
  that provides a command line interface to the Parasolid API, allowing you to 
  build, view, and manipulate Parasolid models on screen. User interaction with 
  KID is via a LISP interpreter, allowing you to call Parasolid functions using 
  Common LISP syntax. This manual is a guide to using KID.</p>
<p><strong><a href="fr_index.html">Reporting Faults to Parasolid:</a></strong> A guide to generating and submitting the data required to report a fault to Parasolid Support for further investigation or make an enquiry.</p>

  Parasolid XT file format.</p>
<p><b><a HREF="fg_index.html">Foreign Geometry User Guide</a>:</b> If you already 
  have your own geometry model for use within your application, you can still 
  use it with Parasolid. This manual explains how you can do this.</p>
<p><b><a HREF="ki_index.html">KI Programming Reference</a>:</b> For long-standing 
  customers, this is the complete reference to the old interface to Parasolid, 
  the Kernel Interface (KI). Although no longer actively developed, support is 
  still provided for legacy code, though you should use the PK interface for any 
  new application code you write. (Only available in HTML)</p>
