<UL>
<LI>
<A NAME="50409922_pgfId-275501"></A>“C<EM>

<LI>
<A NAME="50409922_pgfId-275502"></A>“G<EM>
n</EM>” continuity, which measures the physical continuity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="50409922_pgfId-275503"></A>In both, “<EM>
n</EM>” is an integer specifying the “level” of continuity.  If a geometry has a level of continuity C<EM>
n</EM> or G<EM>
n</EM>, then it is implied that it has continuity C<EM>
m</EM> or G<EM>
m</EM> for all <EM>
m</EM>&lt;<EM>
n</EM>.  For example, a geometry that is C2 continuous is also C1 continuous. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="50409922_pgfId-275504"></A>Continuity of C<EM>
n</EM> also implies G<EM>
n</EM> continuity, but not the reverse: for example a C2 surface is G2, but a G1 curve is not necessarily C1.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="50409922_pgfId-275864"></A>High-level data, accessed via the bulletin board. For example, this data may describe that a new face was created by sweeping a particular edge, where as the lower level data would describe what had happened to each topological entity.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="50409922_pgfId-275869"></A>Trimmed curves contain curve and end-point data which is essential for algorithms which rely on extracting bounded curves of edges, in cases where the vertex points do not lie within the Parasolid linear resolution of edge curves.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="50409922_pgfId-275870"></A>Trimmed curves conveniently package the relevant data and therefore avoid expensive repeated computation of end-points.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="50409922_pgfId-275871"></A>The current implementation of trimmed curves can only be created in the KI interface (as it is not STEP-compliant).</P>

<P>
<A NAME="50409922_pgfId-275875"></A>Performing a local operation on a particular face set of the model, with the result that their surfaces are replaced by the supplied ones, and the edge and vertex geometry is recalculated.</P>
