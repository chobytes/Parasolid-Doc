Parasolid ensures the integrity of models to which these operations are applied remains intact, by making appropriate changes to surrounding topology and geometry. Supported local operations include replacing and transforming specific topologies, hollowing and offsetting, and model simplification via the identification and removal of features such as holes and blends.</P>

If more free-form construction techniques are required, NURBS of any shape can be arbitrarily trimmed to meet a designer's concept.
