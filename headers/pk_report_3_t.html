<A HREF=../headers/pk_report_t.html>PK_REPORT_3_proj_cu_map_c</A> contains the following information about
projections and imprints resulting from <A HREF=../headers/pk_curve_project.html>PK_CURVE_project</A>:

    A total of N int_arrays, double_arrays, old_item_arrays and item_arrays
    will be populated, where N is the number of projections/imprints.

    Each projection can have 1 or 2 products (a topology, a geometry, or both).
    If only one product is returned, it will appear in item_arrays[n][0]. If
    both products are returned, the topology will appear in item_arrays[n][0]
    and the geometry will return in item_arrays[n][1].

    Each projection has an associated projection type, represented by
    a <A HREF=../headers/pk_proj_origin_t.html>PK_proj_origin_t</A> value appearing in int_arrays[n][0]. This allows direct
    projections to be distinguished from edges arising from the imprint
    completion and connection options.
    The achieved tolerance of the projection is in double_arrays[n][0].

    If a geometry is returned, its parametric interval is returned as a
    pair of doubles in double_arrays[n][1,2]. This interval will be (0,0)
    for pure imprints (where no geometry is returned) or point projections.

    Each projection will have 2 or more originators (1 target entity and 1 or
    more originating curves) returned in old_item_arrays[n][0,1,...] and the
    parallel old_class arrays[n]. For each originating curve we return its
    index in the input array, starting with int_arrays[n][1]. If requested,
    each originating curve will have a contributing parametric interval as
    pairs of doubles, starting with double_arrays[n][3,4]. Note that
    originating intervals are not returned for projections arising from
    from imprint completion or connection.

A record of <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_record_type_t.html>PK_REPORT_record_type_3_c</A> that has a status value of
<A HREF=../headers/pk_report_t.html>PK_REPORT_3_outline_result_c</A> contains the following arrays of information about
outlines generated from <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_make_curves_outline.html>PK_BODY_make_curves_outline</A>, <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_make_spun_outline.html>PK_BODY_make_spun_outline</A>
and <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_make_persp_outline.html>PK_BODY_make_persp_outline</A>:

    A total of N item_arrays, 4*N int_arrays, 4*N double_arrays,
    2*N old_item_arrays, and 2*N old_class_arrays will be populated, where N is
    the number of outlines.

    Each outline represents a non-manifold loop formed by a number of curves,
    which are returned in a curve array item_arrays[i] for the ith outline, in
    the order corresponding to the connections of the curves.

    Each array of curves has an array of outline identities (represented by
    <A HREF=../headers/pk_outline_identity_t.html>PK_outline_identity_t</A> values), an array of positions of curves'
    originators, an array of positional indices of large separations, and an
    array of positional indices of invisible outline curves, appearing in
    int_arrays[i], int_arrays[N+i], int_arrays[2*N+i], and int_arrays[3*N+i],
    respectively.

    Each array of curves also has an array of low limits and an array of high
    limits of their curve intervals, an array of curve tolerances, and an array
    of large separations, appearing in double_arrays[i], double_arrays[N+i],
    double_arrays[2*N+i], and double_arrays[3*N+i], respectively.

    Each array of curves has an array of originating topologies, an array of
    the originating topologies' classes, an array of transformations and an
    array of the transformations' classes, appearing in old_item_arrays[i],
    old_class_arrays[i], old_item_arrays[N+i], old_class_arrays[N+i],
    respectively.

    The basic data of the ith outline is grouped in the following parallel
    arrays of length NC, where NC is the number of curves of the outline, which
    varies from outline to outline.

      products: item_arrays[ i ]            - outline curves
                double_arrays[ i ]          - low limits of curve intervals
                double_arrays[ N + i ]      - high limits of curve intervals
                double_arrays[ 2*N + i ]    - curve tolerances
                int_arrays[ i ]             - identities of outline curves
                int_arrays[ N + i ]         - position indices to origs[i]

    The following pair of parallel arrays of length NS hold the information
    about large separations between outline curves in the outline, where
    NS is the total number of large separations with a value between 0 and NC.

        double_arrays[ 3*N + i ]  - large separations
        int_arrays[ 2*N + i ]     - large separation indices to item_arrays[i]

      NOTE: A large separation is the separation between two neighbouring
            curves that is larger than the operation tolerance. The Jth large
            separation in the double_arrays[3*N + i] is the separation
            between the start of the Mth curve in item_arrays[i] and the end
            of its previous curve, where M is the Jth integer value of
            int_arrays[2*N + i].

    The following array of length NI holds the positional indices of invisible
    curves in the outline, where NI is the number of invisible curves with a
    value between 0 and NC.

        int_arrays[ 3*N + i ]   - invisible curve indices to item_arrays[i]

        NOTE: A visible outline only contains visible curves. Therefore it
              has an empty array of invisible curve indices.
              An invisible outline has an array of invisible curve indices that
              is not empty. In addition to its invisible curves, it may also
              contain visible curves if applicable.

    In addition to the two groups of parallel arrays above, the following
    parallel arrays of length NO hold the information about the originators of
    the outline curves, where NO is the total number of originators of the
    outline with a value no less than NC.

      origs:    old_item_arrays[ i ]        - tags of originating topologies
                old_item_arrays[ N+i ]      - tags of body transformations
                old_class_arrays[ i ]       - class of originating topologies
                old_class_arrays[ N+i ]     - class of body transformations

      NOTE: Each curve must have at least one originator, which is normally a
            face or edge associated with a body transformation. For the Kth
            curve in item_arrays[i], the curve's originators start from the
            Mth topology and transformation in the pair of old_item_arrays
            above, where M is the Kth integer value in int_arrays[N + i].
            The tag of originating topology is zero if a curve is not created
            from an outline body, but created following the spun axis or the
            boundary of view range.

    Outline errors related to those originators that prevented the operation
    from producing any outline are reported in the following group of parallel
    arrays, each of length NO, where NO is the number of originators.

      origs:      old_item_arrays[ 0 ]  - tag of originating topologies
                  old_item_arrays[ 1 ]  - tag of the body transformations
                  old_class_arrays[ 0 ] - class of originating topologies
                  old_class_arrays[ 1 ] - class of the body transformations
                  int_arrays[ 0 ]       - outline error types

    Outline errors related to those outline curves that have problems are
    reported in the following pair of parallel arrays, each of length NE,
    where NE is the number of outline curves.

      products:   item_arrays[ 0 ]  - outline curves
                  int_arrays[ 1 ]   - outline error types

  - The first array is of length 1 and contains the number of frames that were

    been requested then this will be set to zero.

  - The second array is parallel to old_item_arrays[0] and contains the
    occurrence number of each frame's owning body.

- a parallel array of <B>'double_arrays'</B>. Each double array contains the
  information on the interval of the ray which intersected the frame's owning
  region. Each double array is of length 7 and contains the following
  information:
  - array[0], array[1], array[2] - the components of the position vector where
    the ray enters the region.
  - array[3], array[4], array[5] - the components of the position vector where
    the ray leaves the region.
  - array[6] - the <B>'distance'</B> value of the picked frame. This is currently
    always set to zero.
