DEFCON ( parent, child, ifail )
===============================

  makes a connection between two entities

Receives:
  KI_tag_topology          *parent         --- parent entity
  KI_tag_entity            *child          --- dependent entity

Returns:
  KI_cod_error             *ifail          --- failure code

Specific errors:
  KI_has_parent             'child' already has a parent
  KI_bad_shared_dep         A dependent of 'child' is illegally shared
  KI_bad_shared_entity      'child' is illegally shared
  KI_wrong_entity           argument of wrong type
  KI_not_in_same_partition  Parent and child are in different partitions

Description:
  Makes a connection between two entities. The acceptable combinations of
  parent and child are:

           parent |          child
         ---------|----------------------------
         Body     | Point, Curve, Surface, List
         Assembly | Point, Curve, Surface, List

  All other connections are either made automatically (e.g. attributes and
  features are created and attached by single routine calls), or more
  specific routines must be used. (e.g. ATTGEO - attach geometry to topology).

  DEFCON will not copy a 'child', thus attachments are further restricted by
  constraints on the sharing of entities:

     o For a geometric entity to be attached to a part neither the entity nor
       any of its dependents may be attached to another topological entity.
       Also neither the entity nor any of its dependents can be shared with
       another orphan entity.

     o A list cannot be attached to more than one part.

  Note: Lists attached to parts will not be archived with them by SAVMOD.
