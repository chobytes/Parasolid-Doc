<B>Specific Errors:</B>
    PK_ERROR_unsuitable_entity   (MILD)    <B>'entities'</B> contains an entity
                                            of class other than body, face
                                            or surface, or is an array of
                                            more than one body.

<A NAME="documentation"></A>
The given <B>'entities'</B> should be an array of one of the following: a single body
(PK_CLASS_body), a collection of one or more faces (PK_CLASS_face) or a
collection of one or more surfaces (PK_CLASS_surf).

This function searches the entities received in <B>'entities'</B> for classic
geometries for which the reliability of Parasolid operations could be improved
by modifying their parameterisation. All of the relevant geometries found are
grouped into sets in which all the contained geometries share a common
parameterisation and must be reparameterised simultaneously to preserve the
geometric dependencies between them (e.g. a collection of offsets of a common
underlying surface and the underlying surface itself.)

The sets are complete in that all geometries not found in the search but whose
parameterisation depends on or supports a geometry in the set are also
included. The parameterisation of geometries within a set will therefore not
be affected by reparameterisations of geometries outside of it. Conversely the
parameterisation of geometries outside of the set will not be affected by
reparameterisation of those within it.

Each set is also associated with a recommended revised parameterisation of the
geometries it contains.

The return structure <A HREF=../headers/pk_entity_find_reparam_r_t.html>PK_ENTITY_find_reparam_r_t</A> contains the sets of geometries
and recommended reparameterisations. See its documentation for more details.

Surfaces of the following classes are checked for reparameterisation:

    PK_CLASS_bsurf
    PK_CLASS_spun ( with the underlying curve of the class PK_CLASS_bcurve )
    PK_CLASS_swept ( with the underlying curve of the class PK_CLASS_bcurve )
    PK_CLASS_offset ( with the underlying surface of one of the above )

The structure <A HREF=../headers/pk_entity_find_reparam_o_t.html>PK_ENTITY_find_reparam_o_t</A> contains user control options. See its
documentation for more details.
