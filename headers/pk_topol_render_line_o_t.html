<A NAME="documentation"></A>
PK_TOPOL_render_line_o_t provides controls for <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_line.html>PK_TOPOL_render_line</A> to
generate view-independent, view-dependent and hidden line drawings of
topological entities through the Graphics Output (GO) interface.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.107.html#50409898_pgfId-294816">option settings</A> for more information in addition to that
provided below.

The controls allow view independent and view dependent data (silhouettes)
to be generated in the same call to <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_line.html>PK_TOPOL_render_line</A>. Hidden line
drawings should be generated in a separate call to <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_line.html>PK_TOPOL_render_line</A>
because their arguments are generally incompatible with those used for
the other categories of drawing.

The options specify which types of lines should be rendered (e.g. edges,
silhouettes, sharp mfins) and what additional data (e.g. visibility and
smoothness) needs to be calculated and handed onto GO.


Mesh Silhouette Method
If <B>'sil_mesh_normal_field'</B> is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_mesh_normal_field_t.html>PK_MESH_normal_field_mvertex_c</A>, mesh
vertex normals will be used to generate silhouette curves on meshes. If set to
<A HREF=../headers/pk_mesh_normal_field_t.html>PK_MESH_normal_field_mfacet_c</A>, mfacet normals will be used. This option is
ignored on classic geometry.

Sharp Mfins
The <B>'sharp_mfins'</B> options controls whether to output sharp mfins on meshes. The
criteria for sharpness are as defined by <A HREF=../headers/pk_mfin_is_sharp.html>PK_MFIN_is_sharp</A>.

The <B>'sharp_mfins'</B> option can be set to one of the following values:

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_sharp_mfins_t.html>PK_render_sharp_mfins_yes_c</A>: On each face with facet geometry, Parasolid will
                             output polylines running along chains of connected
                             sharp mfins. The chains will be divided at any
                             mvertex that has more than two sharp mfins
                             pointing into it.

                             Where an edge is coincident with a chain of sharp
                             mfins, only the edge will be output. In
                             hidden-line drawings Parasolid will indicate that
                             the edge segment is coincident with sharp mfins.

                             Where a sharp mfin polyline lies along a
                             silhouette, only the sharp mfin polyline will be
                             output. In hidden-line drawings Parasolid will
                             indicate that the sharp-mfin segment is coincident
                             with a silhouette.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_sharp_mfins_t.html>PK_render_sharp_mfins_no_c</A> : Parasolid will not output sharp mfins.

Visibility
If <B>'visibility'</B> is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_vis_t.html>PK_render_vis_no_c</A> then no visibility evaluation
(ie hidden line drawing) is performed.  Common visibility requirements may
be requested by the values: <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_vis_t.html>PK_render_vis_hid_c</A>, <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_vis_t.html>PK_render_vis_inv_c</A> and
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_vis_t.html>PK_render_vis_inv_draft_c</A>.  For more refined control over visibility
requirements, <B>'visibility'</B> may be set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_vis_t.html>PK_render_vis_extended_c</A> which
then enables the options: <B>'invisible'</B>, <B>'drafting'</B> and <B>'self_hidden'</B>.
In the  cases of specifying that invisible lines are to be output, an
optional list of body indices into the <B>'topols'</B> array may be specified
to suppress the display of hidden lines only for those bodies.
This is done by supplying the auxilliary data <B>'n_suppressed_indices'</B> and
<B>'suppressed_indices'</B> to indicate the number of bodies and the body indices
respectively. Any hidden lines from these bodies will not be output, and
will not obscure coincident hidden lines on other bodies.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.107.html#50409898_pgfId-302441">Visibility</A> for more information.

Tolerance Values
Each control tolerance is passed as a pair of values, consisting of a
<A HREF=../headers/pk_logical_t.html>PK_LOGICAL_t</A> flag and a double precision value. If a specific tolerance
is required, the variable is set to a strictly positive value and the
associated flag set to PK_LOGICAL_true.

If Parasolid is to use its internal tolerance defaults, the associated flag is
set to PK_LOGICAL_false (and no use made of the associated tolerance argument).
This is the default state set by the PK_TOPOL_render_line_o_m macro.

A report is returned via the Parasolid report mechanism of type
<A HREF=../headers/pk_report_record_type_t.html>PK_REPORT_record_type_3_c</A>. This record will have a <B>'status'</B> of
<A HREF=../headers/pk_report_3_t.html>PK_REPORT_3_render_curve_tols_c</A> and contain the three tolerance values used by
Parasolid, whether supplied or calculated internally.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.108.html#50409899_pgfId-294729">Display Tolerances</A> for more information.

Edge Smoothness
If <B>'is_edge_smooth_tol'</B> is set to true, the value in <B>'edge_smooth_tol'</B>
defines the angular tolerance (in radians) for the smoothness property
in the same way as <A HREF=../headers/pk_edge_is_smooth.html>PK_EDGE_is_smooth</A>.

The criteria for smoothness is defined as being that the angle between the
normals of the two faces that meet at a given edge do not exceed the angle
supplied in <B>'edge_smooth_tol'</B>.

If <B>'is_edge_smooth_tol'</B> is set to false, the angular tolerance used will
depend upon the accuracy of the relevant edge.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.107.html#50409898_pgfId-304123">Tolerance on smooth edges</A> for more information.

Sketching Bodies with Missing Geometry
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_ske_missing_t.html>PK_render_ske_missing_t</A> controls the sketching of bodies containing entities
that have missing geometry.
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_ske_missing_t.html>PK_render_ske_missing_no_c</A>: returns PK_ERROR_missing_geom when encountering
missing geometry.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_ske_missing_t.html>PK_render_ske_missing_yes_c</A>: ignores entities with missing geom and continues
to sketch all other entities.  Any edges with missing geometry will be omitted.
Any faces with missing surface geometry or missing edge geometry will omit
silhouettes or hatched lines, if these have also been requested.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_ske_missing_t.html>PK_render_ske_missing_yes_c</A> is only available when view dependent or view
independent wire-frame rendering has been requested.  It is not compatible with
visibility calculations.

Ignore Small Features
The <B>'ignore'</B> option can be set to one of the following values:

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_ignore_t.html>PK_render_ignore_no_c</A>: (default) All features will be rendered regardless of
their size.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_ignore_t.html>PK_render_ignore_absolute_c</A>: Any feature with a box size smaller than the
value specified will be ignored. If the feature belongs to a body that is being
scaled, this is the box size after the scale is applied.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_ignore_t.html>PK_render_ignore_ratio_c</A>: The <B>'ignore_value'</B> corresponds to the ratio of box
size of the feature to the size of the box containing the entities to be
rendered, taking into account associated <B>'topol_transfs'</B> and <B>'scale_factors'</B>
i.e. if this value is set to 0.01 then all features smaller than 1 per-cent
of the entities' box will be ignored.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_ignore_t.html>PK_render_ignore_body_ratio_c</A>: The <B>'ignore_value'</B> corresponds to the ratio of
the box size of the feature to the size of the box of the body containing the
feature.

This option only takes effect when visibility is not set to
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_vis_t.html>PK_render_vis_no_c</A>. Note that <B>'small'</B> features will only be ignored provided
that ignoring them does not leave the model invalid.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.107.html#50409898_pgfId-304597">Ignoring small features</A> for more information.

Memory Target
The <B>'memory_target'</B> option can be set to one of the following values:

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_memory_target_t.html>PK_render_memory_target_yes_c</A>: Parasolid will attempt to restrict the memory
usage of <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_line.html>PK_TOPOL_render_line</A> to the amount of memory given by
"memory_target_value".  The target value is not guaranteed to be met. The
amount of memory used by <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_line.html>PK_TOPOL_render_line</A> will be reduced at the expense
of total processor time.

The value given by <B>'memory_target'</B> refers to the peak amount of extra memory
temporarily allocated during <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_line.html>PK_TOPOL_render_line</A>.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_memory_target_t.html>PK_render_memory_target_no_c</A>: Parasolid will maximise performance without
attempting to restrict memory usage.

This option only takes effect when visibility is not set to
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_vis_t.html>PK_render_vis_no_c</A>.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.107.html#50409898_pgfId-305625">Controlling memory usage</A> for more information.

Line fit report
If <B>'report_lines'</B> is set to anything but <B>'<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_report_line_t.html>PK_render_report_line_no_c</A>'</B>, then a
report is returned via the Parasolid report mechanism of type
<A HREF=../headers/pk_report_record_type_t.html>PK_REPORT_record_type_3_c</A>. This record will have a <B>'status'</B> of
<A HREF=../headers/pk_report_3_t.html>PK_REPORT_3_line_fit_tols_c</A> and return information for curves that could not
be fitted with a linear approximation both in the event that it could not be
fitted at all and if it was refitted by altering the prescribed chord and
angular tolerances. The curve type, associated edge or face tags, and changed
tolerance values are included in the report for each failed curve fit or
successful refit using altered tolerances.

Radial and Param Default Start Values
If no values are specified for the radial start values then the option
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_radial_t.html>PK_render_radial_yes_c</A> will behave like <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_radial_t.html>PK_render_radial_free_c</A> and
Parasolid will choose the start values. Similarly, if no param start
values are specified then the option <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_param_t.html>PK_render_param_spaced_c</A> will behave
like <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_param_t.html>PK_render_param_spaced_free_c</A> and Parasolid will choose the start values.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.107.html#50409898_pgfId-294866">Hatching</A> for more information.

Overlapping Body Occurrences
By default, Parasolid assumes that rendered instances after they have been
transformed do not overlap. So if you need intersection lines to be generated
then you must set the <B>'overlap'</B> option to specify the required output. You
must use this option if, for example, you require rendering of intersection
lines for an assembly containing clashing instances, i.e. instances that share
a common volume. This option can be set to one of the following values:

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_no_c</A>: Parasolid assumes that the body occurrences to be
rendered do not overlap. If there are overlapping occurrences present then the
overlap will not be detected and the resulting picture may contain errors.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_yes_c</A>: Parasolid will detect overlapping body occurences
and will split the existing lines appropriately. However, the algorithm will
not generate new edges where the faces interfere with each other. The
additional effort of detecting overlaps will incur a performance overhead
compared to <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_no_c</A>.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_intsec_all_c</A>: This option is similar to
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_yes_c</A> but it will also generate and render any interference
curves between body occurrences that overlap. Two arrays of indices into the
<B>'topols'</B> array can be used to limit or "filter" the set of occurrences that are
actually clashed. The fields <B>'n_overlap_indices'</B> and <B>'n_overlap_indices2'</B>
should be set to the number of occurrences in <B>'overlap_indices1'</B> and
<B>'overlap_indices2'</B> respectively. The arrays can be of any size and each body
occurrence in the first array will be clashed with each body occurence in
the second array as long as both arrays contain at least one body occurrence.
If one of the arrays is  empty (either <B>'n_overlap_indices'</B> is 0 or
<B>'n_overlap_indices2'</B> is 0) then all of the body occurrences in the non-empty
array will be clashed with one another. If <B>'n_overlap_indices'</B> and
<B>'n_overlap_indices2'</B> are both are 0 then all occurrences in the <B>'topols'</B> array
will be clashed with one another. The additional effort of detecting overlaps
and interference curves will incur a further performance overhead compared to
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_yes_c</A>.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_intsec_pair_c</A>: This option is similar to
PK_render_intsec_all_c in that it can generate and render interference
curves between body occurrences that overlap.  It requires that both arrays
<B>'overlap_indices1'</B> and <B>'overlap_indices2'</B> are entered and that both have the
same non-zero length (<B>'n_overlap_indices'</B> must equal <B>'n_overlap_indices2'</B>).
Interference curves will be generated for pairs of body occurrences made up of
corresponding entries in the two arrays. The additional effort of detecting
overlaps and interference curves will incur a further performance overhead
compared to <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_yes_c</A>.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_intersect_c</A>: (deprecated) Parasolid will detect overlapping
body occurrences and will split the existing lines appropriately. However, the
algorithm will generate additional new interference curves where the
occurrences intersect. The additional effort of detecting overlaps and
interference curves will incur a further performance overhead over that for
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_yes_c</A>.
If this option is selected, and if the lists are of equal non-zero length,
the behaviour is the same as if the <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_intsec_pair_c</A> option had
been used; otherwise the behaviour is as for <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_overlap_t.html>PK_render_overlap_intsec_all_c</A>.

These options only take effect when visibility is not set to
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_vis_t.html>PK_render_vis_no_c</A>. Abutting body occurrences will always be rendered
correctly, regardless of the setting of the option.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.107.html#50409898_pgfId-305357">Overlapping</A> for more information.

Transparency
There are two methods for rendering transparent bodies:

1 - Attach a <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.124.html#50409918_pgfId-377804">transparency system attribute</A> SDL/TYSA_TRANSPARENCY
(with transparency coefficient of value greater or equal to 1) to all bodies
that are to be rendered transparent, and set the <B>'transparent'</B> option to
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_transparent_t.html>PK_render_transparent_yes_c</A>.

2 - Set the <B>'transparent'</B> option to <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_transparent_t.html>PK_render_transparent_index_c</A>, and then
specify the index value of the bodies (according to the order that they appear
in the array topols[]) that are to be rendered transparent within the array
<B>'transparent_indices'</B>. The value <B>'n_transparent_indices'</B> is the length of this
array. Thus if the body occurrences to be rendered transparent lie in the
third and fifth position of the array topols, then <B>'transparent_indices'</B> will
be {2, 4}, and <B>'n_transparent_indices'</B> will have value 2. This option can be
used to make some occurrences of the same body appear transparent, without the
need to use a transparency attribute.

The <B>'transparent_hid'</B> option can be used to control the rendering of
transparent bodies within hidden line rendering. Setting the <B>'transparent_hid'</B>
option to <A HREF=../headers/pk_render_transp_hid_t.html>PK_render_transp_hid_no_c</A> will render transparent bodies as in the
methods mentioned above. If <B>'transparent_hid'</B> is set to
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_transp_hid_t.html>PK_render_transp_hid_yes_c</A>, then all transparent bodies will be rendered
opaque, but they will only obscure other transparent body occurrences.

For more information, see <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.107.html#50409898_pgfId-303817">Transparency</A> in the Functional Descripion.

Multiple Viewports
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_viewport_t.html>PK_render_viewport_t</A> controls the multiple viewport behaviour.
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_viewport_t.html>PK_render_viewport_no_c</A>: no viewports are supplied. (default)

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_viewport_t.html>PK_render_viewport_yes_c</A>: the single viewport specified in <B>'viewport_sf'</B>
is used. Entities outside the single supplied viewport may be omitted. In this
case, <B>'n_viewports'</B> and <B>'viewports'</B> are ignored.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_viewport_t.html>PK_render_viewport_array_c</A>: an array of viewports is supplied. Entities
outside all the supplied viewports may be omitted. <B>'viewport_sf'</B> is
ignored. The number of viewports used is set in <B>'n_viewports'</B> and can be set
to zero or a positive integer. The array of viewports is specified in
<B>'viewports'</B>.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_viewport_type_t.html>PK_render_viewport_type_t</A> controls the type of viewport being used for this
rendering. Although multiple viewports can be specified, they all must be of
the same type.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_viewport_type_t.html>PK_render_viewport_type_3D_c</A>: allows for a general non-aligned box to be used
to specify a region of a set of bodies to be rendered. (default)

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_viewport_type_t.html>PK_render_viewport_type_2D_c</A>: is used to indicate a 2D viewport. In a 2D
viewport, the <B>'axis'</B> specified in the viewport's <B>'basis_set'</B> (<A HREF=../headers/pk_axis2_sf_t.html>PK_AXIS2_sf_t</A>)
must be the same as the view direction (<B>'view_transf'</B>) specified in the call to
<A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_line.html>PK_TOPOL_render_line</A>. If this is not the case for each viewport, then an error
of type PK_ERROR_bad_2d_viewport will be returned.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.107.html#50409898_pgfId-304451">Viewport</A> for more information.

Viewport Clipping
<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_viewport_clip_t.html>PK_render_viewport_clip_yes_c</A>: This is used to enable clipping to the given
type of viewport.

<A HREF=../headers/pk_render_viewport_clip_t.html>PK_render_viewport_clip_no_c</A>: This is used to indicate that although the
viewport option has been turned on and viewports provided, no clipping will
occur. (default)

Scale Factors
It is possible to associate a scale factor with a body so that the body is
enlarged by the supplied scale factor in the rendering. The centre of scaling
is the origin.

In order to supply scale factors for bodies it is necessary to fill in the
following fields:

<B>'n_bodies_with_scales'</B>
This is the number of bodies with which a scale factor will be associated. If
this is 0, no scaling will occur.

<B>'bodies_with_scales'</B>
This field must be of length <B>'n_bodies_with_scales'</B>, it takes an array of
unique bodies which are to have a scale factor applied. The scale factor for a
given body will be applied to all occurrences of that body.
If this is empty no scaling will occur.  If this is not empty the parallel
array <B>'scale_factors'</B> must be filled in.

<B>'scale_factors'</B>
This field must be of length <B>'n_bodies_with_scales'</B>, each <A HREF=../headers/pk_scale_factor_t.html>PK_scale_factor_t</A>
in this array is the scale associated with the corresponding body in
<B>'bodies_with_scales'</B>.

Note: If <B>'topol_transfs'</B> are supplied any translation component of the
      transform will be applied after the body have been scaled.


Output Scale Factor
It is possible to shrink the returned drawing by providing an
<B>'output_scale_factor'</B> which will be used to scale all the segments returned
with the scaling centre at the origin.  No scaling is applied when the value is
<A HREF=../headers/pk_scale_factor_t.html>PK_scale_factor_1x_c</A>.
