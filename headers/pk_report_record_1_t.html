It has the fields:

<B>'status'</B>           this indicates the status represented by the information
                   in this record.  The <B>'old_items'</B> and <B>'new_items'</B> that are
                   contained in this record depend upon the <B>'status'</B>.
                   See documentation of <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_1_t.html>PK_REPORT_1_t</A>

<B>'n_old_items'</B>      the number of reported items which existed before the
                   operation for which the report was created

<B>'old_items'</B>        an array of items which existed before the operation for
                   which the report was created

<B>'old_classes'</B>      the classes of the items in <B>'old_items'</B>

<B>'n_new_items'</B>      the number of items which have have been created during the
                   operation for which the report was created

<B>'new_items'</B>        an array of items which have been created during the
                   operation for which the report was created



<B>'old_items'</B> relate to pre-operation topologies and <B>'status'</B> values refer
to the class of post-operation topologies derived from them.

The <B>'old_items'</B> array will contain the following entities according
to the value of the <B>'status'</B> field. The typical class of <B>'old_items'</B> for
each value of <B>'status'</B> is given, however exceptions do exist. For these status
types, the <B>'new_items'</B> array is not currently used and <B>'n_new_items'</B> is set to
0.

NOTE: Entity classes given in the following represent typical cases.
