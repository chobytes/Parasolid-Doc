Introduction
The <B>'body'</B> is hollowed. The <B>'offset'</B> argument gives the default offset of the
hollowing - the thickness of the skin of the resulting body. A positive
<B>'offset'</B> will offset the body outwards (i.e. in the direction of the face
normals) and a negative value inwards.

The result of hollowing a body will be to generate a body containing a void.

Under some circumstances the function may need to replace exact geometry by
tolerant geometry. For instance, a four-edge vertex in general will offset
to two three-edge vertices and a connecting edge. If this new edge is smaller
than the supplied tolerance then the vertex becomes tolerant and no new edge
is introduced. In all situations where approximation is required the new
geometry will have a tolerance less than or equal to the tolerance supplied
through the <B>'tolerance'</B> argument.

Many circumstances can give rise to changes in topology. Amongst them are :

    1) Dealing with geometry which fails to offset. If it is known that the
       offset surface of a face would be self-intersecting an attempt is made
       to remove the offset face. For example, a blend may be removed
       from an edge. The investigation of self-intersection is not exhaustive,
       however, and it can occur that instances are not trapped.

    2) Dealing with configurations which can be repaired. For instance,
       an edge can offset to a point or a face can become absorbed into
       the body.


Checking options
The extent to which checking is applied to the body is specified by the
<B>'face_face_check'</B> argument. If <B>'face_face_check'</B> is true then
face-face checks are done on the body in addition to default checks.
For most applications setting <B>'face_face_check'</B> false will give an
adequate level of checking.


Old_faces and new_faces returns arguments
The tag of a face in the original body will remain on the exterior of the
resulting body and will retain the same sense.

Each face to be offset will have a partner created in the final body which is
an offset of the original face.  The interior faces corresponding to the
given <B>'faces'</B> are returned in <B>'new_faces'</B>.

If the hollowing algorithm encounters a situation that will produce a one
to many relationship between faces on the exterior and interior (or vice-versa)
of the final body, then this function will fail with the error:
PK_ERROR_obsolete_function.  For such cases, this function's successor,
<A HREF=../headers/pk_face_hollow_2.html>PK_FACE_hollow_2</A>, must be used.


Error handling
When an error occurs, the function will, where possible, make extra
information regarding the error available to the application
by means of a GROUP.
This GROUP is accessible from the standard form of the error.  Note that,
while the members of the GROUP will be objects which existed before the
call (and so will survive rollback), the GROUP itself will be destroyed by
rollback.  The members of the GROUP will be as follows:

    PK_ERROR_cant_get_point         1 VERTEX   Failed to find new geometry for
                                               existing vertex
                                    n FACEs    Failed to find geometry for
                                               new vertex.

    PK_ERROR_cant_get_curve         1 EDGE     Failed to find new geometry for
                                               existing edge

                                               new edge

                                               No surface replacement is
                                               performed.

    PK_ERROR_edge_didnt_vanish      1 EDGE     An existing edge should have
                                               disappeared
                                    n FACEs    A transient edge should have
                                               disappeared

    PK_ERROR_face_check_fails       1 FACE     Face which failed check

    PK_ERROR_face_face_check_fails  2 FACEs    Pair of faces where
                                               inconsistency found.

    PK_ERROR_cant_offset            1 FACE     Failed to offset or face could
                                               not be deleted
