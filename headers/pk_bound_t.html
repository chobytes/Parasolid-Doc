This datatype specifies how an extruded body or feature is to be bounded.

    PK_bound_distance_c       the extrusion is bounded by a copy of the
                              <B>'profile'</B> at a given distance from the given
                              <B>'profile'</B>.  The distance must be
                              non-negative.  Putting the bound in the
                              opposite direction to the <B>'path'</B> vector is
                              achieved by setting <B>'forward'</B> in the
                              <A HREF=../headers/pk_bound_def_t.html>PK_bound_def_t</A> structure to PK_LOGICAL_false.
                              This may only be used when <B>'extruded_body'</B> is
                              PK_ENTITY_null.

    PK_bound_surf_c           the extrusion is bounded by a given surface.
                              The surface may be given explicitly, or a face
                              may be given, in which case the face's surface
                              will be used. The division may extend beyond the
                              face on the face's surface. The surface is not
                              affected by the operation.

    PK_bound_face_c           the extrusion is bounded by the given face,
                              and, if necessary, whatever adjacent faces are
                              required to complete a division.  The face and
                              any necessary adjacent faces are not affected by
                              the operation.

    PK_bound_body_c           the extrusion is bounded by its intersection
                              with the given body.  The body is not affected by
                              the operation.  The body must be a sheet body or
                              solid body.

    PK_bound_sheet_c          the extrusion is bounded by its intersection
                              with the given sheet body.  When the profile is
                              a wire or sheet body, the bounding sheet body
                              is destroyed by the operation.

    PK_bound_none_c           the corresponding end of <B>'extruded_body'</B> is not
                              altered by this operation.  Can only be used when
                              <B>'extruded_body'</B> is not PK_ENTITY_null.

Note on differences between PK_bound_body_c and PK_bound_sheet_c:  When the
PK_bound_body_c option is given then Parasolid will find candidate faces on
the sheet or solid body which may form a division; ie only some faces
of the given body may be involved in the boolean operation to find the
division.  With the PK_bound_sheet_c option, all faces of the accompanying
sheet body will be used to find divisions.  Hence the difference is largely
one of performance: if the application knows the relevant set of faces then
it is best to use these to create a sheet body (<A HREF=../headers/pk_face_make_sheet_body.html>PK_FACE_make_sheet_body</A>) and
to use the PK_bound_sheet_c option.  If the application does not know which
faces are likely to form the division then the PK_bound_body_c option should
be used.
