This datatype indicates the status of the face blend operation.

It has the values:

 PK_fxf_fault_no_fault_c      The requested blend succeeded.

 PK_fxf_fault_repaired_c      The blend succeeded. Some of the blend surfaces
                              have been repaired or modified to avoid
                              self-intersections or sharp edges. <B>'topols'</B>
                              will contain the faces that have been modified.
                              This token is only returned if the <B>'repair_su_X'</B>
                              option is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_repair_su_x_t.html>PK_blend_repair_su_X_report_c</A>
                              or the <B>'prevent_sharp'</B> option is set to
                              <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_prevent_sharp_t.html>PK_blend_prevent_sharp_report_c</A>.

 PK_fxf_fault_sheet_c         The blend has not been attached,
                              nor have the walls been trimmed
                              but blend sheet bodies have been created.
                              This token is only returned if
                              <A HREF=../headers/pk_face_make_blend.html>PK_FACE_make_blend</A> was called with <B>'walls'</B> set to
                              <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_walls_t.html>PK_blend_walls_both_c</A> or <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_walls_t.html>PK_blend_walls_attach_c</A>
                              represents a partial success.
                              The associated data is a vector in <B>'points'</B>
                              and topological tags in <B>'topols'</B>
                              These indicate the region where the blend could
                              not be attached.

 PK_fxf_fault_unknown_c       The blend could not be created.

 PK_fxf_fault_insufficient_c  The application has supplied insufficient data
                              to define a blend.

 PK_fxf_fault_inconsistent_c  The application has supplied inconsistent data.

 PK_fxf_fault_wall_c          The application has supplied an invalid wall of
                              faces.
                              The associated data in <B>'topols'</B> is the invalid
                              array of faces.

 PK_fxf_fault_range_c         The application has supplied an invalid range
                              definition.

 PK_fxf_fault_thl_c           The application has supplied invalid tangent hold
                              line data.
                              The associated value in <B>'topols'</B> is the invalid
                              tangent hold line data.

 PK_fxf_fault_cliff_c         The application has supplied invalid cliff edge
                              data.
                              The associated value in <B>'topols'</B> is the invalid
                              cliff edge data.

 PK_fxf_fault_curved_c        A face in a wall is too tightly curved
                              for the blend to fit.
                              The associated value in <B>'topols'</B> is the face in
                              question.

 PK_fxf_fault_small_c         A blend range is too small.
                              The associated value in <B>'dists'</B> is the suggested
                              larger range for the blend.

 PK_fxf_fault_large_c         A blend range is too large.
                              The associated value in <B>'dists'</B> is the suggested
                              smaller range for the blend.

 PK_fxf_fault_left_c          <B>'left_sense'</B> is incorrect.

 PK_fxf_fault_right_c         <B>'right_sense'</B> is incorrect.

 PK_fxf_fault_both_c          Both <B>'left_sense'</B> and <B>'right_sense'</B> are
                              incorrect.

 PK_fxf_fault_sheet_clash_c   The blend sheet(s) intersect one another
                              and hence could not be attached.
                              The associated data is a vector in <B>'points'</B>
                              and topological tags in <B>'topols'</B>
                              These indicate which sheet(s) clashed
                              and the point at which they clashed.

 PK_fxf_fault_wall_clash_c    The blend, which has been attached,
                              has combined two bodies and has
                              produced a face-face inconsistency elsewhere
                              in the model.
                              The associated value in <B>'topols'</B> is an array
                              containing the tags of a pair of clashing faces.

 PK_fxf_fault_face_face_c     The blend, which has been attached,
                              has caused a face-face inconsistency.
                              The associated value in <B>'topols'</B> is an array
                              containing the tags of a pair of clashing faces.

 PK_fxf_fault_self_int_c      The blend contains face(s) with self
                              intersecting geometry.
                              The associated value in <B>'topols'</B> is an array
                              containing the tags of the blend faces with
                              self-intersecting surfaces.

 PK_fxf_fault_rho_value_c     The application has supplied an invalid rho
                              value.

 PK_fxf_fault_asymmetric_c    The application has supplied asymmetric ranges
                              which are inconsistent with the underlying
                              geometry.

 PK_fxf_fault_chl_c           The application has supplied invalid conic hold
                              line data.
                              The associated value in <B>'topols'</B> is the invalid
                              conic hold line data.

 PK_fxf_fault_bad_spine_c     The application has supplied an invalid
                              parameter spine.
                              An associated value may be returned in
                              <B>'points'</B>, representing a point where the spine
                              is unsuitable.

 PK_fxf_fault_bad_ribs_c      The application has supplied invalid rib
                              controls.

 PK_fxf_fault_plane_origin_c  The application has supplied a limit or capping
                              plane whose origin does not determine a unique
                              location at which to trim the blend.

 PK_fxf_fault_plane_insuff_c  The application has supplied a limit or capping
                              plane which is not sufficient to trim the blend.
                              For example, if the blend is closed, the
                              application must supply two limit planes.

 PK_fxf_fault_preview_rib_c   No preview rib could be constructed.

 PK_fxf_fault_rho_too_large_c A large rho value has resulted in the blend cross
                              section curvature being too flat compared to the
                              underlying surface(s)

 PK_fxf_fault_depth_value_c   The application has supplied an invalid depth
                              value.

 PK_fxf_fault_skew_value_c    The application has supplied an invalid skew
                              value.
