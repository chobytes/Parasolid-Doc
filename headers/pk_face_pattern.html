A pattern of features is created by specifying a collection of faces
on the target which form the feature and a set of transformation
entities which will determine the pattern. The collection of faces
is copied in-situ and transformed to form the pattern. The pattern
faces specified may belong to a manifold or general body.


Pattern Faces

The collection of pattern faces which are to be patterned must satisfy
the following basic requirements :

   o All the faces must belong to the same body.

   o All the faces of the feature to be patterned, must be
     specified.

The set of pattern faces may have any number of boundaries (circuits of
edges) at which it meets the non-pattern faces.  Each boundary must,
after being transformed, remain coincident with the body, except when the
<B>'coi_face'</B> option is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_coi_face_t.html>PK_pattern_coi_face_unknown_c</A> - see below.
The location of the transformed boundary is restricted to affect only those
topological entities which are initially incident with the pattern
faces.  There are two types of boundary circuit - those that form a
loop inside a non-pattern face, and those that cross non-pattern edges.


Boundary circuits inside non-pattern faces:

If the <B>'same_face'</B> option is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_same_face_t.html>PK_pattern_same_face_yes_c</A> then the
following restrictions apply :

   o After transformation, the boundary loop must remain in the same
     face.

   o A boundary circuit must not be a winding loop.

If the <B>'same_face'</B> option is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_same_face_t.html>PK_pattern_same_face_no_c</A> then these
restrictions are lifted. This is obviously far more general but does -
necessarily - involve more work so if the boundary loops are known to lie in
the same face then it will be more efficient not to use this value.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.056.html#50409840_pgfId-300130">here</A> for more information.

If the <B>'same_face'</B> option is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_same_face_t.html>PK_pattern_same_face_yes_c</A> then the
boundary does not need to remain coincident with the body. If the <B>'coi_face'</B>
option is <A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_coi_face_t.html>PK_pattern_coi_face_unknown_c</A> transformed boundary edges which are
not coincident with the surface of the face will be recalculated. If the
boundary edges are smooth and bounded by blend faces then the <B>'reblend'</B>
option allows the transformed boundary edges to be optionally recalculated
by regenerating their bounding blend faces such that they remain smooth.

If the <B>'same_face'</B> option is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_same_face_t.html>PK_pattern_same_face_no_c</A> and <B>'coi_face'</B>
option is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_coi_face_t.html>PK_pattern_coi_face_unknown_c</A>, <B>'face_maps'</B> can be specified
by the application to help determine the transformed position of the pattern
feature.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.056.html#50409840_pgfId-300280">here</A> for more information.

Boundary circuits which cross non-pattern edges:

If a boundary circuit is connected to non-pattern edges, then those
edges must occur in groups, each of which contains all the edges
coincident with a particular curve (e.g. if the feature consisted of a
chimney in the middle of a roof, the ridge curve of the roof would be
such a curve).

   o There should be an even number of edges in each group, and at
     the vertex where an edge meets the pattern faces, there must be
     exactly one edge which is not adjacent to a pattern face (except
     in the limiting case where two edges graze the pattern faces at a
     single vertex).

   o Each of the edges in a group must have the same number of
     incident faces and the surfaces of these faces must be the same
     or coincident.

   o On transformation, it will be necessary to split existing edges
     and perhaps also faces in order to accommodate an instance of the
     face set.  Any edges or faces which are to be split must either be
     adjacent to the face set initially, or be geometrically the same as
     or a transformed copy of these adjacent topologies.

   o Regions can not be split.

   o If there are any boundary circuits of this type, then none of the
     transforms may contain a reflection component.

Tracking and Error Information

The function returns overall and specific tracking information with
respect to the patterning operation. The tracking information relates
to the pattern faces themselves and not to other faces which may be
created due to splitting non-pattern faces; applications must not
assume anything about the order in which non-pattern faces or edges
are split since this is not defined and may change in future if
internal algorithms are changed. The amount of information returned
will depend on the state of <B>'result'</B> field in the return structure and
the data contained in the <B>'patterns'</B> array :


Patterning result array is empty

 The patterning operation has failed outright and no individual
 pattern data is returned. The <B>'result'</B> field will contain a
 value that reflects the reason for the failure. The <B>'error_topols'</B>
 array may also contain topological data that will help identify
 the reason for the failure.

 This situation will typically arise if there is something wrong
 with the input data.


Result flag indicates partial success

 If the <B>'result'</B> flag indicates partial success by containing the
 value, <A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_result_t.html>PK_pattern_result_partial_c</A>, the <B>'patterns'</B> array will contain
 a pattern data structure for each patterned feature. This array will
 map one-to-one with the <B>'transforms'</B> array input to the function.

 Each pattern data structure only contains data pertaining to a single
 instance of the pattern. The <B>'status'</B> field indicates whether the
 instance of the pattern was successful.

  o If the instance of the pattern was successful, then the
    <B>'pattern_faces'</B> array will contain the newly created faces
    of the pattern. This array will map one-to-one with the
    <B>'pattern_faces'</B> input to the function.

  o If the instance of the pattern was unsuccessful, and the instance
    has not been removed from the body, then the <B>'pattern_faces'</B> array
    will contain the newly created faces of the pattern. The
    <B>'error_topols'</B> array may contain topological data that will help
    identify the reason for the failure (e.g. faces which have been
    found to clash).


Result flag indicates complete success

 If the <B>'result'</B> flag indicates complete success by containing the
 value, <A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_result_t.html>PK_pattern_result_ok_c</A>, the <B>'patterns'</B> array will contain a
 pattern data structure for each patterned feature. This array
 will map one-to-one with the <B>'transforms'</B> array input to the function.

 Each pattern data structure only contains data pertaining to a single
 instance of the pattern. Every <B>'status'</B> field of the pattern data
 structures will indicate a successful operation.

 In each pattern data structure, the <B>'pattern_faces'</B> array will contain
 the newly created faces of the pattern. This array will map one-to-one
 with the <B>'pattern_faces'</B> input to the function.


State of the Body

If the value of the <B>'result'</B> field contains anything other than the
<B>'<A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_result_t.html>PK_pattern_result_ok_c</A>'</B> code, then the input body should be considered
to be in an invalid state. In other words, it will fail to check.

If the value of the <B>'result'</B> field does contain the <B>'<A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_result_t.html>PK_pattern_result_ok_c</A>'</B>
code, then the application programmer still needs to consider the
following :

 o If no checking was specified in the options, the resultant body
   may be invalid.

 o If checking was specified in the options, the instances of the
   pattern may clash.

Pattern Checking

By default and for reasons of performance, minimal checking of the
patterned features takes place. The amount of checking the function
undertakes is controlled via the check flags in the option structure.

Where creation of instances requires edges or faces to be split, then
certain basic checks are always performed.  The points in a group of
edges at which splits are to be made are checked for consistency - if
a clash between two instances is implied, then the later instance is
removed and its returned status will be
<B>'<A HREF=../headers/pk_pattern_status_t.html>PK_pattern_status_outside_fa_c</A>'</B>.

 o Loop checking is controlled via the <B>'check_loops'</B> flag and, if
   enabled, the function checks for clashes between new edges in an
   instance and existing edges which share a face with each other and
   also ensures that complete new loops lie inside a face.  No loop
   checking is performed for pairs of new edges; thus, there may be
   clashing edges in different instances in the result, even if loop
   checking is on.

   If the loop check for a particular pattern instance fails :
     o The instance of the pattern is removed from the body.
     o A suitable status is returned via the pattern data results
       structure which may also include a clashing edge in the
       error topology.

   See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.056.html#50409840_pgfId-299047">Ensuring loops remain in a single face</A> for more
   information

 o Face-face checking is controlled via the <B>'check_fa_fa'</B> flag and if
   enabled, the function checks if any there are any clashes between
   the faces of each instance of the pattern and the non-pattern faces
   of the original body.
   No face-face checking is performed between instances of the pattern.

   If the face-face check for a particular pattern instance fails :
     o The instance of the pattern is NOT removed from the body.
     o A suitable status is returned via the pattern data results
       structure which will include error topology. The error topology
       array will contain pairs of clashing faces. Each pair will be
       returned in the format, pattern face followed by clash face :

         error_topols[ pattenface1 clashface1 patternface2 clashface2 ...]
