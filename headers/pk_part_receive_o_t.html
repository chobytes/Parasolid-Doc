Description of fields:


<B>'transmit_format'</B>           Format of the XT data. Permitted values are:

                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_format_t.html>PK_transmit_format_text_c</A>

                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_format_t.html>PK_transmit_format_applio_c</A>


<B>'receive_user_fields'</B>       PK_LOGICAL_true if user fields are to be received.


<B>'attdef_mismatch'</B>           If this option is PK_ATTDEF_mismatch_ignore_c then
                            parts containing mismatched attribute definitions
                            will be received, but without the mismatched
                            attribute definitions and their associated
                            attributes. See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.102.html#50409892_pgfId-294997">here</A> for more
                            information.


<B>'part_index'</B>                For XT files containing multiple bodies, when
                           <B>'transmit_format'</B> is <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_format_t.html>PK_transmit_format_indexio_c</A>,
                            this is the index of the required body from the
                            array passed by the application to part transmit.
                            This option is ignored if <B>'n_part_indices'</B> &gt; 0.


<B>'part_indices'</B>              An array of length <B>'n_part_indices'</B> selecting
                            the indices of the required bodies from the array
                            passed by the application to part transmit.
                            If <B>'n_part_indices'</B> is 1, all <B>'identifiers'</B> are
                            from the single part index, otherwise
                           <B>'n_part_indices'</B> must equal <B>'n_identifiers'</B> and
                            each identifier is from the corresponding part
                            index. The indices must be in a monotonically
                            non-decreasing order.


<B>'identifiers'</B>               An array of length <B>'n_identifiers'</B> used to select
                            a subset of a part to receive. If <B>'transmit_format'</B>
                            is <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_format_t.html>PK_transmit_format_indexio_c</A> then this should
                            be an identifier of a single face and only the
                            face in this array will be received. Otherwise,
                            if <B>'n_part_indices'</B> is &gt; 0 then this should be
                            identifiers of child bodies and only the child
                            bodies in this array will be received.


<B>'receive_indexed_context'</B>   Application specific storage when <B>'transmit_format'</B>
                            is <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_format_t.html>PK_transmit_format_indexio_c</A>.


<B>'key_is_partition'</B>          Setting this option to PK_LOGICAL_true when
                           <B>'transmit_format'</B> is <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_format_t.html>PK_transmit_format_indexio_c</A>,
                            enables XT data representing an indexed partition
                            to be received. The XT data will be opened with
                            guise FFCXMP rather than FFCXMT, and the XT data
                            must represent an indexed partition. The ordering
                            of bodies used to define their indices is that of
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_partition_ask_bodies.html>PK_PARTITION_ask_bodies</A>.


<B>'receive_compound'</B>          Controls receiving transmit files containing
                            compound bodies. Allowed values are:

                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_compound_t.html>PK_receive_compound_split_c</A>:
                            split any compound bodies into individual bodies

                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_compound_t.html>PK_receive_compound_keep_c</A>:
                            receive compound bodies as they are

                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_compound_t.html>PK_receive_compound_fail_c</A>:
                            fail with PK_ERROR_compound_body if the file
                            contains compound bodies

                            If any compound bodies have been split then a
                            report will be returned via the Parasolid Report
                            mechanism containing a record of <B>'type'</B>
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_record_type_t.html>PK_REPORT_record_type_3_c</A>.
                            This record will have a <B>'status'</B> of
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_3_t.html>PK_REPORT_3_compound_split_c</A> and will contain
                            information on the compound bodies that were
                            split when the file was received:
                            - <B>'n_int_arrays'</B> and <B>'n_item_arrays'</B>
                               the number of parts received from the transmit
                               file.
                            - <B>'int_arrays'</B>
                               for each part received from the transmit file,
                               an array of child body identifiers if the part
                               was a compound body, otherwise an empty array.
                            - <B>'item_arrays'</B>
                               for each part received from the transmit file,
                               an array of split bodies if the part was a
                               compound body, otherwise an array containing
                               just that part.


<B>'receive_using_seek'</B>        How any delayed-load model data in the parts
                            are handled if they are not immediately needed.

                            If this option is <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_using_seek_t.html>PK_receive_using_seek_no_c</A> then
                            delayed-load model data in the file will all
                            be read sequentially in the same Parasolid call.

                            If this option is <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_using_seek_t.html>PK_receive_using_seek_yes_c</A>
                            then only data needed for individual pieces of the
                            model will be received, which will be faster in
                            many scenarios and avoids unneeded model data
                            taking up internal memory.

                            To support <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_using_seek_t.html>PK_receive_using_seek_yes_c</A> for mesh
                            data, the part file must have been transmitted
                            with the option <B>'transmit_meshes'</B> set to
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_meshes_t.html>PK_transmit_meshes_embedded_c</A> and the Frustrum
                            seek function <B>'ffskxt'</B> must be registered using
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_session_register_fru_2.html>PK_SESSION_register_fru_2</A>. If the part file was
                            transmitted with <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_meshes_t.html>PK_transmit_meshes_separate_c</A>
                            then this option is ignored for mesh data.

                            If the part is received or copied to a partition
                            that allows partial pmarks, the application is
                            responsible for maintaining their source copy of
                            the delayed-load information as it may need to
                            be loaded more than once.

                            Transmitting a part with delayed-load model data
                            that is still outstanding will load the missing
                            data as part of the part transmit.

                            This option is ignored for <A HREF=../headers/pk_part_receive_b.html>PK_PART_receive_b</A>.


<B>'receive_mixed'</B>             Controls receiving transmitted files that contain
                            parts with both facet and classic geometry.

                            If this option is set to the default
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_mixed_t.html>PK_receive_mixed_fail_c</A> and the file contains
                            mixed parts, then receive will fail with
                            PK_ERROR_mixed_geometry.

                            To allow receiving mixed parts, this option
                            should be set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_mixed_t.html>PK_receive_mixed_allow_c</A>.

                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_mixed_t.html>PK_receive_mixed_make_facet_c</A> is for future
                            enhancement and will return
                            PK_ERROR_not_implemented.
