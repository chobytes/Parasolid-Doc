<I>This function makes a new curve which is coincident with the given <B>'curve'</B>
but whose parameter increases in the opposite direction along the curve.
It does not support reversal of foreign geometry curves.

The returned curve will contain (at least) all that part of the given
curve which lies within its size box.

If the given curve is periodic then the returned curve will be periodic.

The returned curve will be in the same partition as the received curve.

Note that :

 - no relationship is defined between the parameterisation of the
   given curve and that of the returned curve except that these
   are in opposite directions.

 - if a received curve is bounded, the returned curve need not be
   bounded or bounded as tightly.

 - the concrete class of the returned curve is not constrained to
   be the same as that of the received curve.

 - if the received curve is not an orphan and has dependent geometry (eg. an
   intersection curve or sp-curve) the returned curve will become construction
   geometry of the part containing the received curve, otherwise the returned
   curve will become an orphan.
