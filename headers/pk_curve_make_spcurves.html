<I>This function creates an SPCURVE representation of a curve which lies,
possibly approximately, in a surface.

NOTE: This function is deprecated and has been superseded by
<A HREF=../headers/pk_curve_make_spcurves_2.html>PK_CURVE_make_spcurves_2</A>.

<B>Specific Errors:</B>
    PK_ERROR_bad_precision           tolerance less than modelling resolution
    PK_ERROR_tolerances_too_tight    tolerance too tight
    PK_ERROR_failed_to_create_sp     no spcurves made

<A NAME="documentation"></A>
This function approximates <B>'curve'</B> which lies approximately on <B>'surf'</B> by an
SP_Curve or series of SP_Curves, lying on <B>'surf'</B>.

The arguments are:


<B>'curve'</B>

   Curve to be approximated by SP-curve(s)

   Lies approximately on <B>'surf'</B>.


<B>'range'</B>

   Parametric extent of the part of the given <B>'curve'</B> to be represented by one
   or more SP-Curves.

   If the <B>'range'</B> is sufficiently long to overhang the parameter range of a
   limited surface, then the surface may be extended in order to accommodate
   the SP-curve(s).

   If the given <B>'curve'</B> is a trimmed curve, then the <B>'range'</B> must be contained
   within the bounds of the trimmed curve.

<B>'surf'</B>

   Surface upon which to create SP_Curve(s), <B>'surf'</B> forms the basis surface
   of the new SP-curve(s).

   If <B>'surf'</B> is construction geometry or is attached to a face, within a
   body, the SP-curve will be created as construction geometry
   in that body, and may only be attached to topology within that body.


<B>'degenerate'</B>

   Sp_curves may start or end on surface degeneracies, may lie entirely
   within them, but may not pass through them. A trimmed curve which passes
   through a surface degeneracy will be approximated by at least two
   SP_Curves. If <B>'degenerate'</B> is PK_LOGICAL_true a zero length SP_Curve will be
   returned which joins the otherwise disjoint SP_Curves in parameter space.
   Zero length SP_Curves may not be attached to a model.


<B>'sense'</B>

   If <B>'sense'</B> is PK_LOGICAL_true, then the created SP-curve(s) will start at
   the beginning of <B>'range'</B> and end at the end of <B>'range'</B>.  If <B>'sense'</B> is
   PK_LOGICAL_false, then the SP-curve(s) will be in the opposite direction.


<B>'tolerance'</B>

   The SP-Curve will be created to the distance tolerance <B>'tolerance'</B>, i.e. it
   lies within <B>'tolerance'</B> of the image of <B>'curve'</B> in the surface. The image of
   <B>'curve'</B> in this context means the curve formed by the locus of points
   on <B>'surf'</B> closest to corresponding points on <B>'curve'</B>.

   If the required tolerance cannot be met then the function will fail with
   error PK_ERROR_tolerances_too_tight indicating that
   a larger tolerance may allow a successful approximation.


The returns are


<B>'n_spcurves'</B>

   Number of SP-curves produced


<B>'spcurves'</B>

   Array of SP-Curves of length n_spcurves.



Ownership

The ownership of the newly created SP_Curve(s) is determined by the ownership
of <B>'surf'</B> as follows

    |____________________|___________________|
    | <B>'surf'</B> owner       | SP_Curve owner    |
    |____________________|___________________|
    | Partition          | Partition         |
    | Assembly           | Assembly          |
    | Body               | Body              |
    | Face               | Body owning face  |
