Description of fields:



<B>'connect'</B>                Specifies how to connect disjoint components of
                         the imprint. Permitted values are :

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_connect_t.html>PK_imprint_connect_none_c</A>
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_connect_t.html>PK_imprint_connect_side_c</A>
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_connect_t.html>PK_imprint_connect_all_c</A>
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_connect_t.html>PK_imprint_connect_side_all_c</A>
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_connect_t.html>PK_imprint_connect_hidden_all_c</A>

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-549574">Connecting disjoint components of an imprint</A> for more
information.



<B>'hidden'</B>                 Specifies how imprint of faces is affected by other
                         faces. Permitted values are :

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_face_hidden_t.html>PK_imprint_face_hidden_no_c</A>
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_face_hidden_t.html>PK_imprint_face_hidden_array_c</A>
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_face_hidden_t.html>PK_imprint_face_hidden_body_c</A>




<B>'imprint_complete'</B>       Complete the imprint on the target faces so
                         that the end vertices of the imprint lie on
                         any edge or any laminar edge of the target
                         faces. The incomplete imprint is completed by
                         intersecting the target faces with a plane
                         orthogonal to the target at the end vertices
                         of the incomplete imprint tangential to the
                         imprinted curve. Depending on the value of this
                         option, the imprint will be completed along the
                         direction of this plane until either:

                         o it meets any edge belonging to the target faces
                         o it meets any laminar edge belonging to the
                           target faces.

                         A completed imprint that self-intersects
                         will be trimmed at the point of self-intersection.

                         For more information, see <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-295712">here</A>.


`imprint_coi_exactly`     If <B>'imprint_coi_exactly'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_true
                          then curves coincident with their target surfaces
                          are imprinted exactly where appropriate, rather
                          than being imprinted by projection.
                          See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-296271">here</A> for more information.
                          The default value is PK_LOGICAL_false.


`imprint_exactly`         If <B>'imprint_exactly'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_true
                          then all curves will be imprinted accurately,
                          irrespective of the setting of <B>'imprint_coi_exactly'</B>.
                          See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-296271">here</A> for more information.
                          The default value is PK_LOGICAL_false.


`bidirectional`           If <B>'bidirectional'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_true
                          then all curves will be imprinted in both positive
                          and negative vector direction and edges visible in
                          the view in both directions will be imprinted. If it
                          is set to false then they are only imprinted in the
                          positive direction.
                          The default value is PK_LOGICAL_false.


`process_intersections`   Specifies how to deal with supplied curves that
                          self-intersect or intersect in view (i.e. within a
                          plane perpendicular to the imprint direction vector).
                          Permitted values are :

                          <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_intersect_t.html>PK_imprint_intersect_update_c</A>
                          <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_intersect_t.html>PK_imprint_intersect_fail_c</A>
                          <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_intersect_t.html>PK_imprint_intersect_fix_c</A>

                          The default value is <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_intersect_t.html>PK_imprint_intersect_update_c</A>,
                          which should be used for updating v22.1 and earlier
                          models.
