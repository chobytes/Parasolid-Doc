It has the following fields:

<B>'hole_cyl_radius'</B>                  a double constraint specifying which
                                   cylindrical holes will be identified.
                                   The default will never identify any.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.066.html#50409852_pgfId-295384">Constraining the radius of a cylindrical hole</A> for more
information.

<B>'hole_blended'</B>                     a token indicating whether blend faces
                                   may be included in hole details

                                   See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.066.html#50409852_pgfId-295393">Finding holes with blends</A>

<B>'hole_blend_radius'</B>                a double constraint further restricting the
                                   radii of blends that may be included in
                                   holes

                                   See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.066.html#50409852_pgfId-295393">Finding holes with blends</A>
                                   for more information.

<B>'hole_update'</B>                      enables earlier versions of the hole
                                   identification algorithm if required for
                                   updating parts created in earlier versions.

<B>'hole_const_rad'</B>                   a token indicating whether or not holes must
                                   contain at least one constant radius
                                   component.

<B>'hole_ortho'</B>                       a token indicating whether or not it is a
                                   requirement that components of holes that do
                                   not themselves have surfaces which are
                                   uniquely spun about the hole axis must be
                                   orthogonal to the hole axis.

<B>'hole_perforated'</B>                  a token indicating whether or not holes
                                   can be perforated, i.e. contain inner
                                   boundaries of convex edges. See
                                   <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.066.html#50409852_pgfId-295788">here</A> for more information.

<B>'hole_open'</B>                        a token indicating whether or not holes
                                   can be open, i.e. contain spun or zero-
                                   depth facesets that are not closed rings.

<B>'tolerance'</B>                        a 3 space distance tolerance.

<B>'angle_tolerance'</B>                  an angle tolerance in radians.


Identification of a cylindrical hole is triggered by a face with the following
properties:

 - the face has a surface
 - the surface is a spun surface
 - the face normal points inwards
 - the surface is a ruled surface
 - either the face is bounded by two loops of type PK_LOOP_type_winding_c, or
   it is bounded by one loop of type PK_LOOP_type_inner_sing_c and one loop of
   type PK_LOOP_type_outer_c
 - each loop satisfies the <B>'hole_cyl_radius'</B> constraint

Cylindrical holes may be closed by a face whose surface is any ruled surface
(in particular a plane or cone).  They may also be closed by a blend face (in
particular with a spherical surface), provided that it satisfies the
<B>'hole_blend_radius'</B> constraint.  Cylindrical holes may include other faces
bounded by two loops whose surfaces are ruled surfaces.  Thus countersinks
and counterbores can be included in a cylindrical hole.

Hole components with spun surfaces may only be considered to belong to the same
hole if their axes are co-axial.  To be co-axial, the axes of two components
must separate by no further than <B>'tolerance'</B> within the hole, and must be
parallel to within <B>'angle_tolerance'</B>.

For a hole component to be considered to be of constant radius, then the radii
at each end of it must not differ by more than <B>'tolerance'</B>.

For a hole component to be considered to be orthogonal to the hole axis, the
component must have a planar surface whose normal is parallel to the hole
axis to within <B>'angle_tolerance'</B>.

If <B>'hole_perforated'</B> is <A HREF=../headers/pk_detail_perforated_t.html>PK_detail_perforated_yes_c</A> then <B>'hole_ortho'</B> must
be <A HREF=../headers/pk_hole_ortho_t.html>PK_hole_ortho_yes_c</A>. <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_identify_details.html>PK_BODY_identify_details</A> will then use an alternative
algorithm that can identify a greater range of holes, but has the restriction
that there must not be concave edges around the periphery of the hole.

If <B>'hole_open'</B> is <A HREF=../headers/pk_detail_open_t.html>PK_detail_open_yes_c</A> then <B>'hole_perforated'</B> must be
<A HREF=../headers/pk_detail_perforated_t.html>PK_detail_perforated_yes_c</A>.
