Description of fields:

Scale factors
-------------

It is possible to associate a scale factor with a body such that all facets and
display primitives produced for a body or a region of that body are enlarged by
the supplied scale factor. The centre of scaling is the origin.

In order to supply scale factors for bodies it is necessary to fill in the
following fields:

<B>'bodies_with_scales'</B>
This field, of length <B>'n_bodies_with_scales'</B>, is an array of unique bodies
which are to have a scale factor applied. If this is empty no scaling will
occur. If this is not empty the parallel array <B>'scale_factors'</B> must be
filled in.

<B>'scale_factors'</B>
This field must be of length <B>'n_bodies_with_scales'</B>. Each <A HREF=../headers/pk_scale_factor_t.html>PK_scale_factor_t</A>
in this array is the scale associated with the corresponding body in
<B>'bodies_with_scales'</B>.

Note: If <B>'topol_transfs'</B> are supplied any translation component of the
      transform will be applied after the scale factor is applied.

It is possible to shrink all the facets and display primitives returned by
providing an <B>'output_scale_factor'</B> which will be used to scale all the returned
output with the scaling centre at the origin. No scaling is applied when the
value is <A HREF=../headers/pk_scale_factor_t.html>PK_scale_factor_1x_c</A>.


Faceting options
----------------

The tolerance values are each defined by a pair of <A HREF=../headers/pk_logical_t.html>PK_LOGICAL_t</A> and double
values, the former indicating whether the double value has been set explicitly.
If no explicit tolerance value is provided, Parasolid is free to calculate its
own internal tolerance values. These are generally case specific, rather than
using specific fixed values.

The following tolerances can be set:

<B>'min_facet_width'</B>
In cases where refinement results in a facet being created that has a width
smaller than <B>'min_facet_width'</B> Parasolid will disregard the other tolerances
so that the new facet will not be refined any further. Therefore facets may
exist with dimensions smaller than <B>'min_facet_width'</B>.

Note: The <B>'min_facet_width'</B> is ignored on topologies with facet geometry.

<B>'max_facet_width'</B>
This tolerance is the maximum allowed chord length of the side of a facet.

If both a <B>'min_facet_width'</B> and <B>'max_facet_width'</B> are specified, the
<B>'min_facet_width'</B> must be less than the <B>'max_facet_width'</B> or
PK_ERROR_bad_combination will be returned.

<B>'distance_tol'</B>
This tolerance is the maximum allowed distance from the model geometry to its
associated facet, measured in model units.

<B>'angular_tol'</B>
This tolerance is the angular tolerance between the model geometry and its
associated facet, measured in radians. At edges this is an upper bound of the
sum of the angles between the chord and the curve tangents at either end, and
on a surface this is the maximum allowed deviation of the surface normal within
the facet.
