Types of change operations.

Values can be:

   PK_FACE_change_type_none_c       No operation has been specified for this
                                    face.

   PK_FACE_change_type_offset_c     This operation allows a subset of the
                                    functionality offered by <A HREF=../headers/pk_face_offset_2.html>PK_FACE_offset_2</A>,
                                    and will replace the surface of the face
                                    with one offset by a specified distance
                                    from the surface of either the original or
                                    a reference face. A positive offset
                                    indicates an offset outwards (i.e. in the
                                    direction of the face normal) and a
                                    negative offset an offset inwards. Please
                                    see <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.060.html#50409845_pgfId-294719">here</A> for more
                                    information.

   PK_FACE_change_type_taper_c      The surface of the face will be replaced
                                    with a taper surface. Please see
                                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_face_taper.html>PK_FACE_taper</A>, and also
                                    #here#DOC0141# for more information.

   PK_FACE_change_type_transform_c  This operation transforms the geometry of
                                    the face by the supplied transformation.
                                    Please see <A HREF=../headers/pk_face_transform_2.html>PK_FACE_transform_2</A>, and also
                                    <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.072.html#50409858_pgfId-294728">here</A> for more information.

   PK_FACE_change_type_replace_c    The geometry of the face is replaced with
                                    the supplied surface. Please see
                                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_face_replace_surfs_3.html>PK_FACE_replace_surfs_3</A>, and also
                                    <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.067.html#50409853_pgfId-294751">here</A> for more information.

   PK_FACE_change_type_blend_c      The geometry of the face is replaced with
                                    an appropriate blend/chamfer surface.  If
                                    this operation is being used on a face
                                    with a blend-like surface the blend may be
                                    reapplied with the original or modified
                                    radius, otherwise an appropriate blend/
                                    chamfer surface is calculated based on the
                                    options handed into
                                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_face_change_blend_o_t.html>PK_FACE_change_blend_o_t</A>. Blend faces may
                                    need to be reconstructed after moving other
                                    faces in the body. Please see
                                    <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.074.html#50409860_pgfId-305045">here</A> for more information.

   PK_FACE_change_type_bend_c       This operation is intended to bend or
                                    unbend faces that exist between two groups
                                    of faces that are being transformed.

                                    The bend faces should consist of pairs of
                                    faces which are offsets of each other, and
                                    side faces whose geometry will be ruled
                                    surfaces between these pairs of faces.
                                    The former will be indicated with a <B>'type'</B>
                                    of PK_FACE_change_bend_c, and the latter
                                    side faces with PK_FACE_change_bend_side_c.
                                    As the faces are bent or unbent, these
                                    constraints will remain enforced (ie, the
                                    pairs of offset faces will remain offsets
                                    of each other, and the geometry of the
                                    side faces will be ruled surfaces).

                                    For each pair of faces, a layer is defined
                                    as being any two-dimensional region which
                                    is an offset from the surface of either
                                    face in the pair. Thus, a face whose
                                    surface is coincident with a layer, along
                                    with two offset distances, is enough to
                                    define the geometry of the pair of faces
                                    and all side faces adjacent to them. This
                                    face is referred to as a tool face.

                                    For each pair of faces, it is expected that
                                    the user create a tool face whose surface
                                    is coincident with the layer after the bend
                                    operation has taken place. This, together
                                    with two offset distances, will define the
                                    geometry of the pair of faces and all side
                                    faces adjacent to them after the bend
                                    operation.

                                    Each bend face will in general have a
                                    different bend operation applied to them.
                                    Faces of <B>'type'</B> PK_FACE_change_bend_c
                                    will be supplied with the appropriate tool
                                    face, and the distance (in the direction of
                                    the tool face's normal) that the tool
                                    face's surface must be offset by to obtain
                                    the surface of the bend face.

                                    Faces of <B>'type'</B> PK_FACE_change_bend_side_c
                                    will be supplied with an edge belonging to
                                    a tool face. The ruled surface obtained
                                    when this edge is offset from the tool face
                                    gives the geometry of the side face. Two
                                    distances are required, indicating the
                                    distances (in the direction of the tool
                                    face's normal) that the edge must be
                                    offset by to obtain the surface of the bend
                                    face.

                                    Please see <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.074.html#50409860_pgfId-302569">here</A> for more
                                    information.

   PK_FACE_change_type_patch_c      The geometry of the face is replaced by
                                    faces from a given sheet body.
                                    The following restrictions and limitations
                                    apply to this function :

                                      o The supplied sheet body must be
                                        sufficiently large to completely cover
                                        the faces being replaced without
                                        extension. If any of these faces are
                                        affected by other operations, the
                                        supplied sheet body must then cover
                                        the faces with the effect of such
                                        operations. If boundary edges of the
                                        sheet body are provided as
                                        <B>'patch_edges'</B>, then the sheet need
                                        only cover the area of the faces
                                        within the region enclosed by the
                                        boundary edges.

                                      o The supplied faces must have no
                                        laminar edges, unless those faces form
                                        part of the patch data associated with
                                        the patch operation.

                                    Please see <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.074.html#50409860_pgfId-503185">here</A>.

   PK_FACE_change_type_deform_c     The geometry of the face is deformed
                                    according to the user evaluator function.
                                    The evaluator function receives positions
                                    on the face, and should return the
                                    corresponding position on the deformed
                                    face.

                                    The resultant surface will be C2 smooth. If
                                    the original surface, or the deform
                                    operator, is non-G2, then this may result
                                    in a surface of lower quality.  Please see
                                    <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.074.html#50409860_pgfId-303243">here</A> for more information.

   PK_FACE_change_type_radiate_c    The spun geometry of the face is radiated
                                    by the distance of <B>'radial_displacement'</B>
                                    from its axis of rotation and optionally
                                    further moved by <B>'axial_displacement'</B>
                                    along <B>'axis'</B>.

                                    Please see <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.074.html#50409860_pgfId-925047">here</A> for more
