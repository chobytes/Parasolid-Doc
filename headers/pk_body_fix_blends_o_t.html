The option structure defines options applicable to fixing blends on a body.

Description of fields:

<B>'local_check'</B>       The <B>'local_check'</B> flag and the <B>'checks'</B> data structure are
<B>'checks'</B>            used to control the amount of checking during the blending
                    operation:

                    If <B>'local_check'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_true, then
                    <B>'checks'</B> will be ignored, and the level of local checking
                    will be:

                        No surface self-intersection checks will be performed
                        Face checks will be performed
                        Face-face inconsistency checks will be performed.

                    If <B>'local_check'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_false, then the
                    amount of local checking will be determined by <B>'checks'</B>.

                    If the <B>'local_check'</B> flag is set to PK_LOGICAL_false and
                    a self-intersecting surface or a face-face inconsistency
                    is detected during a local check specified by the
                    application, then <B>'fault'</B> returned by <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_fix_blends.html>PK_BODY_fix_blends</A>
                    will be set accordingly, <B>'fault_edge'</B> will be set to
                    PK_ENTITY_null and <B>'fault_topol'</B> will be set to one of the
                    invalid faces. The blend will have been attached.

                    The faces of all self-intersecting surfaces requested for
                    detection are returned in a report of type
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_1_t.html>PK_REPORT_1_blend_faces_sx_c</A>.


<B>'vx_twin'</B>           The option <B>'vx_twin'</B> is used to request that the
                    integer in <B>'topols'</B> returned by <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_fix_blends.html>PK_BODY_fix_blends</A> be the
                    (dead) tag of the appropriate
                    vertex for those blend faces which are generated
                    from vertices rather than the (dead) tag of an edge.
                    (default is PK_LOGICAL_false). See
                    <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.077.html#50409864_pgfId-296338">Tag of originating vertex</A> for more information.

<B>'setback_data'</B>
<B>'setback_shape_data'</B>
                    The options <B>'setback_data'</B> and <B>'setback_shape_data'</B> are
                    used to control the shape of the blend where three or
                    more blends meet at a vertex. If any blends to be fixed
                    have a cross-section shape of <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_xs_shape_t.html>PK_blend_xs_shape_chamfer_c</A>
                    then setback blends are not allowed. If any blends to be
                    fixed have a <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_t</A> set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_width_c</A>
                    or <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_ratio_c</A>, setback blends are not allowed.

<B>'transfer'</B>          The option <B>'transfer'</B> is used to select whether any
                    topology in the region which has been completely overlapped
                    by the blend will be transferred into the blend faces or
                    whether it will be deleted. See
                    <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.077.html#50409864_pgfId-296369">Preserving overlapped topology</A> for more
                    information.

<B>'propagate'</B>         The option <B>'propagate'</B> controls the amount of propagation
                    that can be performed during the blend fixing operation.
                    Note that propagation must be turned off for facet
                    geometry.

<B>'vx_blend_data'</B>     The option <B>'vx_blend_data'</B> is used to define the shape of
                    the blend where blending past sharp edges of opposite
                    convexity to the blend. If any blends to be fixed have a
                    cross-section shape of <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_xs_shape_t.html>PK_blend_xs_shape_g2_c</A> or
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_xs_shape_t.html>PK_blend_xs_shape_chamfer_c</A>, vertex blending is not
                    allowed: the structure's <B>'vertex_blend'</B> field must be
                    PK_LOGICAL_false. If any blends to be fixed have a
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_t</A> set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_width_c</A> or
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_ratio_c</A>, vertex blending is not allowed: the
                    structure's <B>'vertex_blend'</B> field must be PK_LOGICAL_false.

<B>'y_blend_data'</B>      The option <B>'y_blend_data'</B> is used to define the shape of
                    the blend where two blends on adjacent edge of opposite
                    convexity meet. If the blend to be fixed has a non-
                    circular cross-section shape (e.g. G2), y blends are not
                    allowed: the structure's <B>'y_blend'</B> field must be
                    PK_LOGICAL_false.
                    If any blends to be fixed have a <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_t</A> set to
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_width_c</A> or <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_ratio_c</A>, y blends
                    are not allowed: the structure's <B>'y_blend'</B> field must be
                    PK_LOGICAL_false.

<B>'preserve_notch'</B>    The option <B>'preserve_notch'</B> only has an effect when a
                    sheet body is being blended. If it is set to
                    PK_LOGICAL_false, <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_fix_blends.html>PK_BODY_fix_blends</A> will make
                    a simple curve within the blend surface to bridge a laminar
                    notch. If this option is set to PK_LOGICAL_true, the shape
                    of the notch is projected normally onto the blend surface
                    to bridge the notch gap. If a solid body is being blended
                    this option has no effect and is ignored.
                    See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.077.html#50409864_pgfId-296585">Preserving notch shape</A> for more information.

<B>'update'</B>            The default value allows applications to take advantage of
                    the latest enhancements to the blending algorithm. To
                    maintain consistency when rebuilding models created in a
                    previous version of Parasolid, a non-default value should
                    be specified.
                    See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.077.html#50409864_pgfId-300038">Update control</A> for more information.

<B>'tolerance'</B>         The options <B>'set_tol'</B> and <B>'tolerance'</B> control whether a
<B>'set_tol'</B>           tolerance may be applied to the blend.
                    <B>'set_tol'</B> must be set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_set_tol_t.html>PK_blend_set_tol_no_c</A> for facet
                    geometry.

<B>'repair_su_X'</B>       The option <B>'repair_su_X'</B> controls whether or not Parasolid
                    will attempt to repair blend surfaces that are
                    self-intersecting. It only has an effect on conic rolling
                    ball blends. Parasolid will create suitable faces to patch
                    the self-intersecting regions. This option will only
                    attempt to repair blends that are self-intersecting due to
                    an underlying surface of the blend being too tightly
                    curved to support the blend if the <B>'inside_tight'</B> option
                    is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_inside_tight_t.html>PK_blend_inside_tight_faces_c</A> or
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_inside_tight_t.html>PK_blend_inside_tight_partial_c</A>.

                    If 'repair_su_X' is set to any value other than
                    '<A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_repair_su_x_t.html>PK_blend_repair_su_x_no_c</A>', then the faces of all
                    self-intersecting surfaces that could not be repaired are
                    returned in a report of type <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_1_t.html>PK_REPORT_1_blend_faces_sx_c</A>.

                    If any blends to be fixed have a <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_t</A> set to
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_width_c</A> or <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_ratio_c</A>,
                    <B>'repair_su_X'</B> must be set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_repair_su_x_t.html>PK_blend_repair_su_X_no_c</A>.

                    See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-311603">Repairing self-intersecting blends</A> for more
                    information.

<B>'output_sheet'</B>      The option <B>'output_sheet'</B> controls whether the blend
                    should be attached or created as a separate sheet body.
                    If the <B>'output_sheet'</B> option is set to
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_output_sheet_t.html>PK_blend_output_sheet_on_fail_c</A>, the blend sheet body
                    (possibly disjoint) produced may not remain consistent over
                    different builds of Parasolid. Future improvements to
                    blending functionality may result in failing blends
                    succeeding. Thus, application updates should not depend
                    upon a blend failing and producing a blend sheet body.

<B>'inside_tight'</B>      The option <B>'inside_tight'</B> controls whether blends will be
                    created on the inside of faces that have a smaller radius
                    of curvature than the blend. Switching this option on also
                    enables cliff-edge overflows on the inside of cliff-edges
                    that are more tightly curved than the blend radius. This
                    option will only apply to blends set by using
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_edge_set_blend_constant.html>PK_EDGE_set_blend_constant</A>, or conic blends set via
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_edge_set_blend_chain.html>PK_EDGE_set_blend_chain</A>. The values
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_inside_tight_t.html>PK_blend_inside_tight_faces_c</A> or
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_inside_tight_t.html>PK_blend_inside_tight_partial_c</A> may only be supplied if the
                    <B>'repair_su_X'</B> option is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_repair_su_x_t.html>PK_blend_repair_su_X_yes_c</A>
                    or <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_repair_su_x_t.html>PK_blend_repair_su_X_report_c</A>.  In the latter case any
                    blend faces created on too tightly curved faces will be
                    returned as repaired.  The value
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_inside_tight_t.html>PK_blend_inside_tight_no_c</A> is not currently implemented for
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_fix_blends.html>PK_BODY_fix_blends</A> and should not be supplied.
                    See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.077.html#50409864_pgfId-297504">Creating blends inside tight corners</A> for
                    more information.

<B>'vx_order_data'</B>     The option <B>'vx_order_data'</B> controls the order in which
                    blends are applied at vertices with edges of different
                    convexity. If any blends to be fixed have a <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_t</A>
                    set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_width_c</A> or <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_ratio_c</A>,
                    <B>'n_vertices'</B> must be set to 0.

<B>'ov_smooth'</B>         The options <B>'ov_smooth'</B>, <B>'ov_notch'</B> and <B>'ov_order'</B> control
<B>'ov_notch'</B>          the result returned when two blends on edges that do not
<B>'ov_order'</B>          share a common vertex overlap with each other. The
                    combination <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_ov_smooth_t.html>PK_blend_ov_smooth_yes_c</A> and
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_ov_notch_t.html>PK_blend_ov_notch_yes_c</A> is not currently implemented and
                    should not be supplied. The option <B>'ov_order'</B> must be set
                    to either <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_order_t.html>PK_blend_order_concave_convex_c</A> or
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_order_t.html>PK_blend_order_convex_concave_c</A>. If any blends to be fixed
                    have a cross-section shape of <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_xs_shape_t.html>PK_blend_xs_shape_chamfer_c</A>,
                    or any blends have a <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_t</A> set to
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_width_c</A> or <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_ratio_c</A>, then
                    <B>'ov_smooth'</B> must be set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_ov_smooth_t.html>PK_blend_ov_smooth_no_c</A>.
                    Note that <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_ov_notch_t.html>PK_blend_ov_notch_yes_c</A> is not implemented for
                    blends on facet geometry.

<B>'repair_fa_X'</B>       The option <B>'repair_fa_X'</B> controls whether or not Parasolid
                    will attempt to repair blend faces that are
                    self-intersecting.

<B>'explicit_cliff_edges'</B>
<B>'explicit_cliff_edges_type'</B>
                    The options <B>'explicit_cliff_edges'</B> and
                    <B>'explicit_cliff_edges_type'</B> are used together to
                    explicitly define cliffing behaviour upon the edges
                    contained in the list of edges <B>'explicit_cliff_edges'</B>.
                    For every element in <B>'explicit_cliff_edges'</B> there should
                    be a corresponding element in the list
                    <B>'explicit_cliff_edges_type'</B>. The elements of
                    <B>'explicit_cliff_edges_type'</B> are of type
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_ov_exp_cliff_t.html>PK_blend_ov_exp_cliff_t</A> and can take the value
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_ov_exp_cliff_t.html>PK_blend_ov_exp_cliff_no_c</A> or <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_ov_exp_cliff_t.html>PK_blend_ov_exp_cliff_yes_c</A>.
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_ov_exp_cliff_t.html>PK_blend_ov_exp_cliff_no_c</A> specifies that regardless of
                    all other options cliffing should not occur upon the
                    associated edge. <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_ov_exp_cliff_t.html>PK_blend_ov_exp_cliff_yes_c</A> specifies that
                    cliffing should occur upon the edge overriding the
                    behaviour specified by other options. If any blends to be
                    fixed have a cross-section shape of
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_xs_shape_t.html>PK_blend_xs_shape_chamfer_c</A>, then explicit cliffs must not
                    be supplied. If any blends to be fixed have a
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_t</A> set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_width_c</A> or
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_ratio_c</A>, then explicit cliffs must not be
                    supplied.

<B>'partition'</B>         An optional user-supplied partition may be supplied in
                    <B>'partition'</B>. If a partition is supplied and the blend
                    options specify the blend result is to be returned as
                    sheets, rather than attached to the body being blended,
                    then those resultant sheets will be placed within this
                    user-supplied partition. Default behaviour assumes no
                    partition supplied ( PK_PARTITION_null ) and any resultant
                    sheets are placed in the partition associated with the
                    body being blended.

<B>'cap_data'</B>          Specifies user-defined controls for how the blend should
                    be capped. See the documentation for <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_cap_data_t.html>PK_blend_cap_data_t</A>
                    for more information. If any blends to be fixed have a
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_t</A> set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_width_c</A> or
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_ratio_c</A>, <B>'n_caps'</B> must be zero.

<B>'improve_tolerance'</B> The option <B>'improve_tolerance'</B> controls some changes to
                    the blending algorithm which help to reduce the tolerance
                    on newly created topology. If this option is set to
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_tolerance_t.html>PK_blend_tolerance_standard_c</A> (the default) these
                    changes are disabled.

<B>'tracking_type'</B>     Determines the tracking information that is returned
                    regarding the underlying topologies and geometries used
                    to create a blend. See <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_fix_blends.html>PK_BODY_fix_blends</A> for details.

                    This option can only be set to
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_track_type_t.html>PK_blend_track_type_unders_c</A> if the option <B>'vx_twin'</B>
                    is set to PK_LOGICAL_true. If <B>'vx_twin'</B> is not set
                    appropriately PK_ERROR_bad_combination will be returned.


<B>'laminar_trim'</B>      This option allows the user to control the trimming
                    behaviour of a blend created on a laminar edge of a
                    sheet body. The user can choose between trimming the blend
                    so that it is continuous with both underlying surfaces,
                    or trimming it along a continuous parameter line so that it
                    joins up continuously with the longer underlying surface
                    only.

<B>'limit_data'</B>        The option <B>'limit_data'</B> provides a means of constraining
                    the blend by applying limits. If any blends to be fixed
                    have a <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_t</A> set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_width_c</A> or
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_ratio_c</A>, <B>'n_limits'</B> must be zero.

<B>'limit_topols'</B>      An array of faces and/or fins which will be used to stop
                    the blend. If the blend encounters a face or fin from this
                    array, it will stop and be trimmed to end in a
                    constant parameter line at that point. If any blends to be
                    fixed have a <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_t</A> set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_width_c</A>
                    or <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_size_t.html>PK_blend_size_ratio_c</A>, <B>'length'</B> must be zero.

<B>'limit_topols_patch'</B>
                    If supplied, this should be an array of the same length
                    as <B>'limit_topols'</B>. Each element in this array specifies
                    whether to try patching the blend beyond the corresponding
                    limit topology specified in the <B>'limit_topols'</B> array.

<B>'limit_topols_unders'</B>
                    If supplied, this should be an array of the same length
                    as <B>'limit_topols'</B>. Each element in this array is an array
                    of topologies which specifies whether the corresponding
                    limit topology should only limit blends that are blends
                    between the specified underlying topologies.

                    Each topology array in the <B>'limit_topols_unders'</B> should be
                    either of length zero or length two. If the array is of
                    length two then the array should contain a pair of faces;
                    the limit topology will only limit blends that are between
                    that pair of underlying faces. If the array is of length
                    zero then the corresponding limit topology will limit all
                    blend faces that meet the limit topology.

                    Underlying topologies may only be supplied for limit
                    topologies of class PK_CLASS_fin; if the limit topology is
                    not of class PK_CLASS_fin then the corresponding entry in
                    <B>'limit_topols_unders'</B> should be an array of length zero.

                    If <B>'limit_topols_unders'</B> is not supplied then the blend
                    will stop at any entry in <B>'limit_topols'</B> that the blend
                    meets.

<B>'suggest_limit'</B>     This option allows the user to control whether they wish
                    the suggested limit data to be returned as a report should
                    an edge blend failure occur. Future improvements to
                    blending functionality may result in failing blends
                    succeeding. Thus, application updates should not depend
                    upon a blend failing and returning a certain set of
                    suggested limits. This option will not return limits
                    on facet geometry.

<B>'report'</B>            Whether to report any repaired blend faces in the
                    Parasolid report stream. Any records will be of type
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_record_type_t.html>PK_REPORT_record_type_1_c</A> and will have a status of
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_1_t.html>PK_REPORT_1_rep_sx_faces_c</A> or <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_1_t.html>PK_REPORT_1_rep_G2_faces_c</A>.
                    In the first case the report will list those blend faces
                    created by repairing self-intersections.
                    In the second, the blend_faces reported are those from
                    G2 blends which have been modified to preserve continuity
                    when crossing G2-discontinuous edges.
                    ( <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_report_repaired_t.html>PK_blend_report_repaired_no_c</A> )

<B>'extension_shape'</B>   This option controls how underlying classic surfaces of
                    faces and classic curves of certain edges are extended for
                    G2 blends. If the surfaces/curves are extended linearly,
                    then blends built on the extension may have a C1
                    discontinuity on the boundary. Setting this option to
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_extension_shape_t.html>PK_extension_shape_soft_c</A> avoids this, but may require
                    surfaces of faces to be extended as a result. Any edges
                    given as cliff edges that bound one of these faces may
                    also need their curves softly extended.

                    The surfaces/curves whose soft extension are used to
                    construct the blend and whether they have been
                    permanently extended, will be reported in a
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_3_t.html>PK_REPORT_3_geom_extended_c</A> report. Any surfaces/curves
                    that could not be extended or already contain
                    discontinuities will also be reported in a
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_3_t.html>PK_REPORT_3_blend_x_g1_c</A> report.

                    All edge blends set on the body must have a cross section
                    shape of either <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_xs_shape_t.html>PK_blend_xs_shape_g2_c</A> or non-circular
                    conic when the option is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_extension_shape_t.html>PK_extension_shape_soft_c</A>,
                    otherwise the error PK_ERROR_bad_combination will be
                    raised.
                    ( <A HREF=../headers/pk_extension_shape_t.html>PK_extension_shape_linear_c</A> )

<B>'report_extended'</B>   Whether to report any chamfer faces that are
                    extended outside of their natural width in the
                    Parasolid report stream. Any records will be of type
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_record_type_t.html>PK_REPORT_record_type_3_c</A> and will have a status of
                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_3_t.html>PK_REPORT_3_chamfer_extended_c</A>.
