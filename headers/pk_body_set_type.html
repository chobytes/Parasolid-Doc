    PK_ERROR_bad_orientation        Unable to set the body type to Solid
                                    because the faces have inconsistent
                                    orientation. (SERIOUS)

    PK_ERROR_bad_type               Either the user passed in
                                    PK_BODY_type_unspecified_c as <B>'new_type'</B>,
                                    or asked for a conversion that is
                                    not supported (e.g. Sheet to Wire). (MILD)

    PK_ERROR_laminar_edge           The supplied body has at least one
                                    laminar edge and thus cannot become
                                    a solid. (MILD)


    PK_ERROR_unsuitable_topology    The conversion is not possible due to
                                    topological reasons (e.g. mixed dimension
                                    of a general body). (MILD)


<A NAME="documentation"></A>

This function tries to change the type of the body (e.g. from General to
Solid) to the type specified by <B>'new_type'</B>. If the change is not possible,
an error is returned and the body is not changed, except when trying to
change a body to Solid. In that case the body may have changed during the
conversion attempt, if it was indeed changed a serious error is returned.
In all other cases if an error is returned it is mild.

The following type conversions are supported currently (provided they
make sense topologically):

a) General -&gt; Solid/Sheet/Wire/Acorn/Minimum

b) Solid/Sheet/Wire/Acorn/Minimum -&gt; General

c) Solid -&gt; Sheet

d) Sheet -&gt; Solid

Conversion to the General type should always work.

At present no attempt is made to correct any faults/peculiarities in the
body which may prevent the type change. Notably, the orientations of faces
are not changed by this function. This means that converting a Sheet (or
General) body to a Solid will fail when the faces appear to form a sensible
solid body, if one or more of them are incorrectly oriented. See
<A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.015.html#50409796_pgfId-295859">here</A> for more information.


If the change is from Sheet to Solid or vice versa, the region(s) that must
become solid/void are changed appropriately, no other change to the topology
is performed (apart from setting the body type).

The supplied type must be a valid and specific Parasolid body type,
PK_BODY_type_unspecified_c is not allowed.

Other Parasolid APIs exist that can be used to convert a model from one
type to another or derive a model of a different type from pre-existing
models. These APIs include:
