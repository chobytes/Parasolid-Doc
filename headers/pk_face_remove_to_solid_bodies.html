<I>This function separates a body into two or more bodies by selecting which
faces are to be removed into new bodies.

This function offers partial support for facet geometry [PF]

<B>Specific Errors:</B>

    PK_ERROR_wire_body           (MILD)    unable to make solid from wire body
    PK_ERROR_dont_make_solid     (SERIOUS) cannot make solid from given
                                           <B>'faces'</B>
    PK_ERROR_non_manifold        (MILD)    cannot heal wound with non-manifold
                                           boundary
    PK_ERROR_not_in_same_part    (MILD)    <B>'faces'</B> not all from same body

    PK_ERROR_bad_selection_code  (MILD)    a disallowed heal action has been
                                           requested
    PK_ERROR_cant_heal_wound     (SERIOUS) cannot heal wound - impossible

See also <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.073.html#50409859_pgfId-294771">Removing faces to create new bodies</A> for more information.

All of the given <B>'faces'</B>, which must belong to the same body, are removed into
one or more new bodies.
A new body is created from each set of connected faces in the given set of
faces and from each set of connected faces remaining from the original body.
Bodies arising from the given set of faces are referred to as <B>'child_bodies'</B>
and bodies arising from the remaining faces are referred to as <B>'parent_bodies'</B>.

The faces must not form the shell of a sheet body.  If the faces form an
interior (void) shell of a solid, then that shell is removed into a solid.
If a resulting body does not have a complete boundary, then any
holes are treated as wounds which are healed as specified by a heal action.
For parent bodies <B>'parent_heal_action'</B> may take the values:

    PK_FACE_heal_no_c               don't heal wounds - leave rubber faces
    PK_FACE_heal_cap_c              find a surface in which all edges of a hole
                                    lie and attach this to a face covering the
                                    hole. The cap option supports facet
                                    geometry, but only when all the faces
                                    around the wound are facet
    PK_FACE_heal_grow_from_parent_c grow the faces the parent had around the
                                    hole until they cover it

For child bodies <B>'child_heal_action'</B> may take the values:

    PK_FACE_heal_no_c               don't heal wounds - leave rubber faces
    PK_FACE_heal_cap_c              find a surface in which all edges of a hole
                                    lie and attach this to a face covering the
                                    hole. The cap option supports facet
                                    geometry, but only when all the faces
                                    around the wound are facet
    PK_FACE_heal_grow_from_child_c  faces around the hole are extended until
                                    they cover the hole
    PK_FACE_heal_grow_from_parent_c grow the faces the parent had around the
                                    hole until they cover it

The <B>'local_check'</B> argument specifies whether checks on newly created
topological and geometrical entities are to be performed, and the
<B>'parent_check_results'</B> and <B>'child_check_results'</B> arguments return the result
of such checks.
These arguments may take the values:

    <A HREF=../headers/pk_local_check_t.html>PK_local_check_no_c</A>             local checking not performed either because
                                    <B>'local_check'</B> was PK_LOGICAL_false or the
                                     heal action was PK_FACE_heal_no_c
    <A HREF=../headers/pk_local_check_t.html>PK_local_check_ok_c</A>             body passes local checks
    <A HREF=../headers/pk_local_check_t.html>PK_local_check_negated_c</A>        as initially created, body was inside out
                                    but it has been negated and is now valid
    <A HREF=../headers/pk_local_check_t.html>PK_local_check_failed_c</A>         body fails local checks - it is
                                    self-intersecting

Rubber faces can not be grown to heal other wounds.

This function will not operate on faces from a general body.
