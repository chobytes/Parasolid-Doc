This datatype contains information that classifies how a face intersects
a bounded curve.

It has the following values:

  PK_intersect_fc_simple_c       The curve passes through the surface of the
                                 face at a single point.
  PK_intersect_fc_tangent_c      The curve touches the surface of the face at
                                 single point but does not pass through it.
  PK_intersect_fc_out_in_c       The curve passes from being outside the face
                                 to the interior of the face.
  PK_intersect_fc_in_out_c       The curve passes from being in the interior
                                 of the face to the outside of the face.
  PK_intersect_fc_out_coi_c      The curve passes from being outside the face
                                 to a region of coincidence with the boundary
                                 of the face.
  PK_intersect_fc_coi_out_c      The curve passes from a region of coincidence
                                 with the boundary of the face to being
                                 outside the face.
  PK_intersect_fc_coi_in_c       The curve passes from a region of coincidence
                                 with the boundary of the face to being inside
                                 the interior of the face.
  PK_intersect_fc_in_coi_c       The curve passes from being inside the
                                 interior of the face to a region of
                                 coincidence with the boundary of the face.
  PK_intersect_fc_in_tangent_c   The curve is tangent to the inside of an edge
                                 or passes through a vertex, but remains
                                 outside the face.
  PK_intersect_fc_out_tangent_c  The curve is tangent to the outside of an
                                 edge or passes through a vertex, but remains
                                 outside the face.
  PK_intersect_fc_in_c           The start or end of the curve is inside the
                                 face or lies in its boundary.
  PK_intersect_fc_start_c        The curve enters the face at the start of a
                                 region of coincidence with the surface.
  PK_intersect_fc_end_c          The curve leaves the face at the end of a
                                 region of coincidence with the surface.

PK_intersect_fc_simple_c and PK_intersect_fc_tangent_c are used only when
curve and the surface of the face intersect at a single point. All other
values are used when all or part of the curve lies in the surface.
