PK_boolean_result_t has the following values. For each of the values except
PK_boolean_result_failed_c, the resultant entities are returned within the
<B>'bodies'</B> array.

  PK_boolean_result_success_c    The boolean succeeded and the resultant
                                 entities are returned within the <B>'bodies'</B>
                                 array.

  PK_boolean_result_no_clash_c   The boolean succeeded, however there was no
                                 interaction between any of the target and
                                 tool entities. This means that, taking the
                                 material side settings into account, none of
                                 the target and tool entities clashed with one
                                 another. Also, none of the resulting entities
                                 contain solid regions with bounding shells
                                 that come from more than one of any of the
                                 target or tool entities.

  PK_boolean_result_no_effect_c  The boolean succeeded, however the tools had
                                 no effect on the target, and therefore the
                                 target body is returned unchanged.

  PK_boolean_result_imprint_c    The boolean succeeded, however the target
                                 body is unchanged except that it may have
                                 gained some mergeable edges or vertices.

  PK_boolean_result_not_solid_c  The boolean succeeded, however the resultant
                                 entities cannot be converted into solid
                                 bodies.

  PK_boolean_result_multiple_c   This value is deprecated and is only
                                 returned when asking the session to behave
                                 as an earlier version.

  PK_boolean_result_failed_c     The boolean failed. The <B>'bodies'</B> array will
                                 be returned as null. The report structures
                                 must be inspected to determine the reason for
                                 the failure and to identify the location of
                                 the failure. If this status is returned, the
                                 input bodies may have been modified and the
                                 application cannot assume that they are in a
                                 valid state.
