This datatype is used to return the status of a three face blending operation.

 PK_3_face_blend_ok_c             The requested blend succeeded.

 PK_3_face_blend_sheet_c          The blend has partially succeeded.
                                  Blend sheet bodies have been created.
                                  The walls have not been modified.

                                  The associated data is a vector in <B>'points'</B>
                                  and topological entities in <B>'topols'</B>.
                                  These indicate the region where the blend
                                  failed.

 PK_3_face_blend_fail_c           The blend could not be created for an
                                  unspecified reason.

 PK_3_face_blend_bad_guide_c      The wire guide given by the application is
                                  invalid.

                                  Associated data may be returned as an edge or
                                  vertex in <B>'topols'</B> and a vector in <B>'points'</B>
                                  representing a point where the guide
                                  is unsuitable.

 PK_3_face_blend_bad_wall_c       The application has supplied an invalid wall
                                  of faces.

                                  The associated data in <B>'topols'</B> is the
                                  invalid array of faces.

 PK_3_face_blend_bad_orient_c     The application has supplied an unsuitable
                                  orientation.

 PK_3_face_blend_unoriented_c     The orientation of a wall was given as
                                  <B>'<A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_orientation_t.html>PK_blend_orientation_unknown_c</A>'</B> and no
                                  suitable orientation could be obtained.

 PK_3_face_blend_bad_blend_tol_c  The blend tolerance supplied is non-positive.

 PK_3_face_blend_bad_prop_tol_c   The propagation tolerance supplied is
                                  non-positive.

 PK_3_face_blend_sheet_clash_c    The blend sheet(s) intersect one another
                                  and hence could not be attached.

                                  The associated data is a vector in <B>'points'</B>
                                  and topological entities in <B>'topols'</B>.
                                  These indicate which sheet(s) clashed
                                  and a point at which they clashed.

 PK_3_face_blend_wall_clash_c     The blend, which has been attached,
                                  has combined input bodies and has
                                  produced a face-face inconsistency elsewhere
                                  in the model.

                                  The associated value in <B>'topols'</B> is an array
                                  containing a pair of clashing faces.

 PK_3_face_blend_face_face_c      The blend, which has been attached,
                                  has caused a face-face inconsistency.

                                  The associated value in <B>'topols'</B> is an array
                                  containing a pair of clashing faces.

 PK_3_face_blend_self_int_c       The blend contains face(s) with self
                                  intersecting geometry.

                                  The associated value in <B>'topols'</B> is an array
                                  containing the blend faces with
                                  self-intersecting surfaces.

 PK_3_face_blend_inconsistent_c   The application has supplied inconsistent
                                  data.

 PK_3_face_blend_plane_origin_c   The application has supplied a limit or
                                  capping plane whose origin does not
                                  determine a unique location at which to trim
                                  the blend.

 PK_3_face_blend_plane_insuff_c   The application has supplied a limit or
                                  capping plane which is not sufficient to
                                  trim the blend.
                                  For example, if the blend is closed, the
                                  application must supply two limit planes.

 PK_3_face_blend_bad_help_c       Supplied help point does not determine a
                                  unique blend sheet from a multiple set of
                                  sheets that have been found. It lies
                                  equidistant to two or more sheets.
