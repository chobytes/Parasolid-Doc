<I>This structure is returned after attempting to imprint vectors on a mesh. It
holds a status identifying the nature of the success or failure, an array of
the indices of the vectors in the input array caused the failure, and an array
of defects in the <B>'resultant_mesh'</B>.

Any space allocated by Parasolid within this structure may be freed by calling
<A HREF=../headers/pk_mesh_imprint_vectors_r_f.html>PK_MESH_imprint_vectors_r_f</A>.

The structure has the following fields:

<B>'status'</B>:            Token indicating whether the vectors were successfully
                     imprinted onto the mesh and whether there were any
                     defects in the <B>'resultant_mesh'</B>.

                     Tokens that indicate success are:
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_success_c</A>,
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_defects_c</A>.

                     Tokens that indicate failure are:
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_wrong_mtopol_c</A>
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_bad_parameter_c</A>
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_off_mesh_c</A>
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_bad_clusters_c</A>.

                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_wrong_mtopol_c</A> and
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_bad_parameter_c</A> take precedence over
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_off_mesh_c</A> and
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_bad_clusters_c</A>.

                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_off_mesh_c</A> takes precedence over
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_vecs_t.html>PK_imprint_vecs_bad_clusters_c</A>.

<B>'error_indices'</B>:     If any of the vectors supplied were not within session
                     precision of the mesh, or were not within session
                     precision of their corresponding mtopol/parameter given
                     in the options structure, then this array will contain
                     the indices of those vectors in the input array.
                     Otherwise if any input vectors were in a cluster of
                     vectors which could not be resolved into a single vector
                     to imprint, the vectors from all such clusters will have
                     their indices from the input array included in
                     `error indices'. (See documentation for
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_mesh_imprint_vectors.html>PK_MESH_imprint_vectors</A> for a definition of a "cluster".)
                     Otherwise this array will be null.

<B>'defects'</B>:           An array of all the defects in the <B>'resultant_mesh'</B>
                     caused by imprinting the vectors. If there are no such
                     defects this array will be null. Note that if there
                     were defects in the original mesh then there may be
                     defects in the <B>'resultant_mesh'</B> which are not in the
                     array, as they were not caused by imprinting. However if
                     a vector is imprinted near an existing defect this may be
                     returned.
