CREFEA ( type, part, featre, ifail )
====================================

  Create a feature

Receives:
  KI_cod_tyfe              *type           --- type of feature
  KI_tag_part              *part           --- part which will own feature

Returns:
  KI_tag_feature           *featre         --- newly created feature
  KI_cod_error             *ifail          --- failure code

Specific errors:
  KI_wrong_type_for_feat    feature type cannot be created in 'part'

Description:

  Creates an empty feature in the specified part.

  Features created in assemblies may have types:

      TYFEIN    Instance feature
      TYFESU    Surface feature
      TYFECU    Curve feature
      TYFEPT    Point feature
      TYFEMX    Mixed feature

  If any but TYFEMX is given, the feature will be permitted to contain entities
  only of the specified type. A mixed feature in an assembly can contain
  entities of any of the four types.

  Items can be contained in a feature in an assembly only if they belong to the
  assembly. Surfaces, curves and points must be construction geometry attached
  to the assembly. Instances must be owned by the assembly.

  Features created in bodies may have types:

      TYFERG    Region feature
      TYFEFA    Face feature
      TYFEED    Edge feature
      TYFEVX    Vertex feature
      TYFESU    Surface feature
      TYFECU    Curve feature
      TYFEPT    Point feature
      TYFEMX    Mixed feature

  If any but TYFEMX is given, the feature will be permitted to contain entities
  only of the specified type. A mixed feature in a body can contain
  entities of any of the seven types.

  Items can be contained in a feature in a body only if they are contained
  within the body. Surfaces, curves and points may be either construction
  geometry attached to the body or be attached to a face, edge or vertex in the
  body. Regions, faces, edges and vertices must be contained within the body.
