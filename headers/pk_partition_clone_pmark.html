<I>This function applies to the <B>'partition'</B> the changes between the original pmark
corresponding to the current clone pmark of the partition and the given
<B>'original_pmark'</B>.

Note: You are advised to consult with Parasolid Support before using
cloning.

<A NAME="errors"></A>
<B>Specific Errors:</B>
    PK_ERROR_rollback_not_started   Partitioned rollback is not active (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_unsuitable_entity      Cloning is not started in <B>'partition'</B>
                                    or <B>'original_pmark'</B> is not from a clone
                                    span (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_modified_sub_part      Some entities that would be affected have
                                    changed from their state in the clone
                                    span (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_copy_failed            The clone operation failed (SERIOUS)

<A NAME="documentation"></A>
This function performs a similar action to <A HREF=../headers/pk_pmark_goto_2.html>PK_PMARK_goto_2</A>.  If the
changes being cloned affect only restricted areas of a part in the
partition then the cloning operation can be performed to make those
same changes even if other areas of the part are not identical to
those in the clone span.

If the changes involve changes to members of a closed group then cloning may
proceed even though the members of the group may not be the same as the members
of the group in the clone span because the groups have evolved separately as
a result of differing merge, split and delete events. If the changes involve
changes to members of a group which is not closed then cloning can only proceed
if all members of the group are identical to their equivalents in the clone
span.

If the changes involve changes to attributes of a closed group then cloning
may only proceed if the present group and the group in the clone span are
identical.

This function should only be called when partitioned rollback has been started
with <A HREF=../headers/pk_delta_register_callbacks.html>PK_DELTA_register_callbacks</A>.
