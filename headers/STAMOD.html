STAMOD ( kijon, nchars, jfilnm, usrfld, world, kivrsn, ifail )
==============================================================

  Starts the modeller

Receives:
  KI_cod_logical           *kijon          --- flags whether to write journal
                                           --- file or not
 &lt;KI_int_nchars&gt;           *nchars         --- number of characters in journal
                                           --- file name (used only if kijon is
                                           --- set to true)
  KI_chr_filename           jfilnm[nchars] --- name of journal file
  int                      *usrfld         --- size of user fields (in integers)

Returns:
  KI_tag_entity            *world          --- world
  int                      *kivrsn         --- version number of interface being
                                           --- invoked
  KI_cod_error             *ifail          --- failure indicator

Specific errors:
  KI_cant_open_jrnl         Journal file could not be opened
  KI_bad_filename           Character string is not a valid file name
  KI_bad_user_field_size    User field length is negative or longer than maximum
  KI_incorrect_mc_conf      Machine configuration not authorised for Parasolid
  KI_modeller_not_stopped   STAMOD already called since the last call to STOMOD

Description:
  This routine starts up the modeller and must be called before any other. It
  may not then be called again until STOMOD has been called. If the journal
  flag 'kijon' is set to true then journal records will be sent to the specified
  file for each call to the interface.

  The length (in integers) of user fields may also be specified. The maximum
  length is 16 integers; specifying a length of zero will result in no user
  fields being allocated. Note that in order to receive an archived part with
  its user fields, it is necessary that the user field length for the current
  session be the same as when the part was archived.

  The world entity (which contains all loaded assemblies and bodies) is
  returned.

  The interface parameters are initialised: see SEINTP for documentation of
  the default values.

  The version number of the kernel is returned in 'kivrsn'; when read as a
  decimal integer it is of form Mmmbbb, where M is the major version number
  of Parasolid, mm is the minor version number and bbb is the build number,
  which identifies when the copy of Parasolid currently being run was
  compiled.  The entire version number should always be quoted in any
  correspondence with your supplier of Parasolid.

  On platforms where it is possible to vary the machine configuration in ways
  that would affect Parasolid (eg, the format of floating point numbers or the
  endian-ness of numbers) the modeller will not be started if the current
  configuration is not recognised as being safe. In this case the ifail
  KI_incorrect_mc_conf will be returned.
