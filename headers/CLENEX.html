Description:
  CLENEX will find global or local closest approaches between 'ents1' and ents2'.
  Where a single global closest approach is requested 'ents1' and 'ents2' can
  either be single entities or lists of entities. If all local closest approaches
  are required then both 'ents1' and 'ents2' must be single entities.

  The following entity types are supported:
      - Geometrical: point, curve, and surface.
      - Topological: vertex, edge, face, and body.

  Curves and surfaces must be legally attachable to edges and faces, and must
  be G1 continuous.


  The entities supplied must either all be geometry or all be topology.

  The function returns the number of closest approaches found and collection
  of lists all of the same length. Taken together the n'th entries of these
  list form a description of the n'th closest approach found, as follows:

  The entry from the list 'min_dists' is a real value for the distance of the
  closest approach, and 'entpts1' and 'entpts2' corresponding entries hold the
  points between which the closest approach is achieved (as lists of 3 reals).
  The entries in 'elists1' and 'elists2' are lists, of length 2, which identify
  the entities and sub-topology upon which those solution points lie. These lists
  will be structured as follows:

       - The first list component will be the tag of the (received) entity
         upon which the solution point was found to lie.

       - The second list component will indicate a sub-topology upon which the
         solution point was found to lie. This sub-topology will be either a
         face, edge or vertex, belonging to a received entity. If the solution
         does not lie on sub-topology a 'NULTAG' will be returned.

  If either of the entities in the list has a tolerance associated with it, the
  solution on that entity will only be accurate and unique up to the tolerance
  of the entity.

  Solution parametrisation is provided by the entries in the 'parms1' and
  'parms2' lists when appropriate. These entries are real lists of length 2
  holding curve or surface parameter/s. Which parametrisation is used is firstly
  dependent upon the geometry of entity returned and secondly upon the
  geometry of the sub-topology (if identified). If curve parametrisation is
  used the 2nd list component should be ignored.


  The table below indicates what parametrisation is used and when:

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    |   Entity    |  Identified Sub-topology  |     Geometry used for      |
    |             |                           |  solution parametrisation  |

    |             |                           |                            |

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  The curve and surface parameter values returned, will be the same as would
  be returned by the parametrisation functions ENPAPC, and ENPAPS.

  Properties:

  Properties of the closest approach are returned through the entries in the
  'props1' and 'props2' lists. Each entry is a list of tokens ( of variable
  lengths given by the entries in 'nprops1' and 'nprops2' ). These properties
  and their tokens are as follows:

      - RTCLRS: The solution is a regional solution upon the entity (i.e it
        is possible to move from solution point pair without the distance
        changing )
        The identification of such a regional solution is not guaranteed.

      - RTCLND: For a body only, the distance as being negative. The distance
        will be classified as negative if the solution point on the other
        entity lies inside the body

  In the case that there are no solutions, i.e. upper or lower bounds (see below)
  have been set that rule out all closest approaches, 'nmins' will
  be set to 0 and the lists 'props1' and 'props' will be of length 1. The
  only entry in these lists will be a list holding a single token indicating
  why no solutions could be found:

      - RTCLLB No solution being returned because the distance was found to
        be less than the lower bound

      - RTCLUB: No solution being returned because no distance was found to be
        less than the upper bound

  Options:

  Various options are available through the use of 'nopts' 'iopts' & 'optdta'.
  'nopts' specifies the number of options requested, 'iopts' is an array of
  option types, and 'optdta' is an array of lists of corresponding option data.
  Some options are only available for restricted cases.

  The following option, 'CLOPTL', is available under all circumstances:

      - A tolerance on the accuracy of the minimum distance measurement. This
        will allow slacker computation of minimum distance, when the
        default accuracy is not required. The default accuracy will be the
        linear precision of the modeller (set up by SEMODP).

  An option, 'CLOPFA', is available to request that all local closest approaches
  should be returned. At present this option is incompatible with all the other
  options mentioned below. It is also only available in the case that 'ents1'
  and 'ents2' are single entities.

  If the option for searching for all closest approaches is omitted, then
  the following options are available. Some of these do have restrictions of
  their own.

  The following  options are available regardless of how many entities
  or what entity types are supplied:

      - An upper bound on the minimum distance to be computed may be supplied.
        If such a bound is supplied the minimum distance achieved will only be
        identified if it is less than the bound.

      - A lower bound on the minimum distance. For this option, if the closest
        approach between entities is found to be less than this bound, no
        solution will be determined and a token will be returned to indicate
        that the minimum distance is less than this bound.


  The following additional options will be available but only for limited
  cases. These options must only be allowed to refer to a single entity,
  and not a list of entities nor a single component of an entity list.

      - For a single curve or edge, a curve parameter estimate may be
        supplied.

      - For a single surface or face, surface parameter estimates may be
        supplied.

      - For a single curve, surface, edge, or face, a position vector estimate
        may be supplied. Such an estimate is expected to be on or close to the
        entity.

  Both parameter and position vector estimates cannot be supplied for an entity.

  The use of any of the above estimates is not allowed if the minimum distance
  computation involves a body (e.g. a face cannot be given estimates for
  a face-body computation).


  The table below details the tokens and data required for the options.
