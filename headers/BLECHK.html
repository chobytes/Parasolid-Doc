BLECHK ( edges, full, nerror, errors, erreds, topols, ifail )
=============================================================

  Check the local validity of unfixed blends.

Receives:
  KI_tag_list_edge         *edges          --- edges to check
  int                      *full           --- level of checking

Returns:
  KI_int_nitems            *nerror         --- number of invalid blends
 &lt;KI_tag_list_int&gt;         *errors         --- list of failure codes, the
                                           --- codes are given below
 &lt;KI_tag_list_edge&gt;        *erreds         --- list of invalid edges
 &lt;KI_tag_list_entity&gt;      *topols         --- list of tags associated with
                                           --- the failure codes
  KI_cod_error             *ifail          --- failure code

Specific errors:
  KI_general_body           general body
  KI_bad_spec_code          value of 'full' out of range

Description:
  This is a diagnostic function, used to determine  why BLEFIX failed, or whether
  an alteration in an unfixed blend has removed a problem.

  For  each edge in  'edges'  that has a  blend attribute attached the associated
  blending  surface parameters  are checked for   consistency  with  geometry and
  blend attributes attached  to neighbouring entities. Edges in 'edges' that have
  no blend attribute attached are ignored.
  If  'full' is 1, the blending surface parameters are checked for consistency at
  the vertices.  If 'full'  is 2, additional checks are  made to ensure that  the
  blend  boundaries are legal.  Even  if BLECHK   finds  no inconsistencies,  the
  blends are not guaranteed to fix; some problems can  only be detected by BLEFIX
  making up the new faces.

  'nerror'  is the number of edges in 'edges' for which blending errors have been
  found. The list 'erreds' contains the tags of those edges for which errors were
  found  and 'errors' and  'topols' are two  parallel  lists of failure codes and
  associated topology tags.

  Some failure  codes  have  no associated  entity: in these cases  the entry  in
  'topols' will  be  the  null  tag. The   meanings  of the failure  codes in the
  'errors' list and the corresponding types of entity in the 'topols' list are as
  follows:
