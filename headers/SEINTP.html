                            Binary/text snapshot control code lies outside range
                            Binary transmission control code lies outside range
                            Bulletin board control code lies outside range

Description:
  The value of 'pnum' is used to indicate which parameter to set and thereby
  which value ('ival' or 'rval') to use. At present this routine only receives
  integer parameters.

  The valid values of 'pnum' and the corresponding parameters are:

  'pnum'    receive  parameter

  SLIPCH    'ival'   Flag indicating whether other KI routines and PK routines
                     should test their parameters.  Passing  non-zero
                     'ival' will turn it on. This flag is set to
                     non_zero in STAMOD.

                     When this is off dead and null tags are still trapped by
                     KI routines but not by PK routines.

  SLIPJO    'ival'   Flag indicating whether calls to KI routines will produce
                     output in the journal file. Passing non-zero 'ival' will
                     turn it on.

                     This flag is set in STAMOD according to the value of the
                     received argument. If journalling was not requested in
                     STAMOD ('kijon' set to false) then 'ifail'
                     KI_journal_not_open will be returned from SEINTP if it
                     is called with 'pnum' set to SLIPJO regardless of the
                     value of 'ival'.

  SLIPBB    'ival'   Flag indicating whether the Kernel maintains a bulletin
                     board. The defined values of 'ival' are:
                          0  no bulletin board maintained
                          1  bulletin board is emptied and will be maintained
                             for tags only
                          2  bulletin board is emptied and will be maintained
                             for tags and user fields
                     This flag is set to zero in STAMOD.

                     If 'ival' is 1 or 2 then a default bulletin board state
                     is initialised.  This will instruct the bulletin board
                     to record information about faces, edges and vertices
                     (types TYTOFA, TYTOED and TYTOVX) for events create,
                     delete and change (event types BBEVCR, BBEVDE and BBEVCH)
                     and bodies and assemblies (types TYTOBY and TYTOAS)
                     for events create and delete. See SEBBCO for more
                     information.

  SLIPRB    'ival'  Integer flag indicating if logging for rollback is to be
                     enabled. This must be set in order that roll-back marks
                     may be set. Passing non-zero 'ival' will turn it on.

                     The absolute value of 'ival' is the maximum size, in
                     bytes, of the rollback file. This size should be a few
                     times the size of the model and typically will be several
                     Mbytes. Routine FFOPRB may allocate a file of smaller size,
                     and the actual size may be discovered by a call to OUINTP.

                     This flag is set to zero in STAMOD.

  SLIPRF    'ival'   Integer flag indicating whether roll forward is to be
                     enabled. This must be set while rollback is switched off.

                     If 'ival' is 1 rolling forward will be enabled when
                     rollback is enabled.

                     If 'ival' is 0 then less information needs to be stored
                     in the rollfile.

                     This flag is set to 0 in STAMOD.

  SLIPBT    'ival'  Controls the transmit and receive format, which can be
                    either text, machine-dependent binary, neutral binary,
                    or using application-registered i/o functions. The allowed
                    values of 'ival' are:

                          1      text  Receive,    text  Transmit
                          2     binary Receive,    text  Transmit
                          3      text  Receive,   binary Transmit
                          4     binary Receive,   binary Transmit
                          5      text  Receive,  neutral Transmit
                          6     binary Receive,  neutral Transmit

                          7     applio Receive,    text  Transmit
                          8     applio Receive,   binary Transmit
                          9     applio Receive,  neutral Transmit
                         10     applio Receive,   applio Transmit
                         11      text  Receive,   applio Transmit
                         12     binary Receive,   applio Transmit

                     Values outside this range return KI_bad_value.

                     If ival is 5, 6, or 9, Parasolid will write machine-
                     independent binary files. These can be read in
                     as normal binary transmit files, i.e. with ival
                     set to 2, 4, 6, or 12.

                     This flag is set to 1 in STAMOD.

  SLIPSN    'ival'  Controls whether snapshot files are binary or text.
                    The defined values of 'ival' are:
                          1      text  get snapshot,    text save snapshot
                          2     binary get snapshot,    text save snapshot
                          3      text  get snapshot,   binary save snapshot
                          4     binary get snapshot,   binary save snapshot

                     Values outside this range return KI_bad_value.

                     This flag is set to 4 in STAMOD.

  SLIPLC    'ival'   Flag indicating whether the Kernel will perform local
                     checks of geometry and topology after a local modification
                     is made to the model by CRFASU, CRSOFA, DELFAS, RMFASO,
                     SWEENT, SWIENT, TWSUFA, TWEFAC, TAPFAS or BLEFIX.
                     Passing non-zero 'ival' will turn local checking on.

                     This flag is set to non-zero in STAMOD.

  SLIPDC    'ival'   Flag indicating whether limited checks on the consistency
                     of geometry attached to a model with ATTGEO and
                     neighbouring geometry will be performed.
                     Passing non-zero 'ival' will turn data checking on.

                     This flag is set to zero in STAMOD.

  SLIPUF    'ival'   Controls whether user-field information is received from
                     archived parts. Normally this should be set to 1 so that
                     models are received with the same user-field values as when
                     they were transmitted. However, there are situations where
                     this is undesirable (for example, when receiving a model
                     with a different user-field length). In this case SLIPUF
                     should be set to zero so that user-fields in parts received
                     subsequently will be set to zero. See GETMOD for further
                     details.

                     This flag is set to 1 in STAMOD.

  SLIPSI    'ival'   Flag indicating whether the Kernel will perform self
                     intersection checks on geometry during those operations
                     which require the geometry to pass the checks imposed by
                     CHCKEN. Passing non-zero 'ival' will turn self intersection
                     checking on.

                     This flag is set to non-zero in STAMOD.

  SLIPCO    'ival'   Flag indicating whether the Kernel will perform composite
                     geometry checks on B-curves and B-surfaces when determining
                     whether the geometry can be modeled as a single topological
                     entity.

                     The defined values of `ival are :

                              0       Perform all composite geometry checks
                              1       Perform no composite geometry checks

                     Values outside this range return KI_bad_value.

                     This flag is set to zero in STAMOD.

  SLIPTL    'ival'   Integer flag indicating if tag limitation is enabled.
                     Passing a non-zero 'ival' will turn it on, a zero 'ival'
                     will turn it off. A non-zero value of 'ival' less than
                     an existing tag will return KI_tag_limit_out_of_range.

                     If non-zero, the modeller will check all tags allocated
                     against an upper bound equal to the absolute value of
                     'ival'. An operation that would otherwise result in the
                     allocation of tags exceeding 'ival' will fail, returning
                     KI_tag_limit_exceeded.

                     This flag is set to zero in STAMOD.


  SLIPGS    'ival'   Flag indicating whether generated surfaces can be
                     created during a call to SWEENT or SWIENT.
                     If non-zero, generated surfaces can be created during
                     a call to SWEENT or SWIENT. If zero, B-surfaces
                     will be created instead.

                     This flag is set to zero in STAMOD.

  SLIPGT    'ival'   Flag indicating whether general bodies are to be legally
                     returned by KI functions - principally boolean operations.
                     With SLIPGT set to zero, general bodies will not be
                     returned and the operations will fail with the same ifail
                     as at previous versions i.e. KI_non_manifold.
                     With SLIPGT set to one, general bodies will be returned as
                     valid results.

                     This flag is set to zero in STAMOD.
