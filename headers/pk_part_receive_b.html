<B>Specific Errors:</B>
    PK_ERROR_schema_access_error   Error opening, closing, or reading the
                                   schema file (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_schema_corrupt        Contents of schema file not as expected

    PK_ERROR_schema_incompatible   Schema contents in newer format (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_wrong_format          File does not have expected transmit
                                   format (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_bad_file_format       Format <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_format_t.html>PK_transmit_format_applio_c</A> not
                                   allowed (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_wrong_version         File transmitted by incompatible version
                                   of modeller (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_corrupt_file          Invalid transmit file contents
                                   (MILD/SERIOUS)
    PK_ERROR_file_read_corruption  Corrupt data read (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_size_mismatch         Transmitted parts created with different
                                   modeller resolution settings (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_attr_defn_mismatch    Transmitted attribute definitions do not
                                   match current ones (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_usfd_mismatch         File has incompatible user-field size (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_withdrawn_surface     File contains a withdrawn blend surface
                                   (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_FG_receive_failure    Part contains irretrievable foreign
                                   geometry (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_bad_field_conversion  Part contains data not convertible to
                                   current format (MILD)

If the <B>'receive_compound'</B> option is <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_compound_t.html>PK_receive_compound_fail_c</A>:

    PK_ERROR_compound_body         A part is a compound body (MILD)

If the <B>'n_part_indices'</B> option &gt; 0:

    PK_ERROR_bad_index             The index of a part is out of range or
                                   does not correspond to a compound body
                                   (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_not_found             The child body identifier was not found
                                   (MILD)

If facet geometry is not enabled in the session:

    PK_ERROR_facet_geometry        A part contains facet geometry (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_lattice_geometry      A part contains a lattice (MILD)

If the <B>'receive_mixed'</B> option is <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_mixed_t.html>PK_receive_mixed_fail_c</A>:

    PK_ERROR_mixed_geometry        A part contains mixed facet and classic
                                   geometry (MILD)

<A NAME="documentation"></A>
The parts are returned in the same order that they were transmitted by
PART transmit.

Option <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_format_t.html>PK_transmit_format_applio_c</A> is not allowed.

If the <B>'receive_user_fields'</B> option is set to true, user-fields will be
received from the transmit file, if they are present in the file. If the
user-field size in the transmit file is non-zero, but not the same as the
user-field size in the session, the error PK_ERROR_usfd_mismatch will be
returned.

If the <B>'receive_user_fields'</B> option is set to false, and user fields are in use
in the session, received entities will have their user fields set to zero.

When a part is created the modeller stores in the part the current values for
the linear and angular resolution of the modeller and these values will be
saved with the part in a transmit file. If the resolution values saved with the
part are different from the current values, PK_ERROR_size_mismatch will be
returned.

The definitions of any attributes attached to a part are stored with a part in
the file. When a part is received the modeller may discover a mismatch between
an existing attribute definition and a stored definition with the same
identifier. If this occurs PK_ERROR_attr_defn_mismatch will be returned.

If the transmit file was transmitted by a version of the modeller which is
newer than the current version, PK_ERROR_wrong_version will be returned.

If the parts contain foreign geometry for which an evaluator is not available,
the offending surfaces or curves are identified by having a system attribute
of type SDL/TYSA_BAD_FG attached. Parts containing such geometry must not be
used. This mechanism allows individual parts in a file to be used despite the
presence of other parts containing unusable foreign geometry. Applications
using foreign geometry must check for the presence of this attribute and
delete such parts.
