<I>This function outputs one or more outlines of a body or bodies for a given
spin axis as a set of ordered curves together with their intervals.
</I>
<A NAME="errors"></A>
<B>Specific Errors:</B>
    PK_ERROR_bad_component          <B>'transfs'</B> is inappropriate (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_unsuitable_entity      a received body is neither solid
                                    nor cellular (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_non_manifold           Outline is non-manifold (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_failed_to_make_outline Function failure (MILD)
    PK_ERROR_failed_to_facet        Failed to facet (MILD)

<A NAME="documentation"></A>
The function is only implemented for solid and cellular bodies.
The outlines of cellular bodies are created from the faces selected by
<A HREF=../headers/pk_session_set_cellular_guise.html>PK_SESSION_set_cellular_guise</A>.

If the <B>'transfs'</B> argument is NULL, no transforms are applied to the bodies and
the bodies array must not contain duplicates.

If the <B>'transfs'</B> argument is not NULL, it refers to an array of <B>'n_bodies'</B>
<A HREF=../headers/pk_transf_t.html>PK_TRANSF_t</A> entities. Each body is transformed by its corresponding entry in
<B>'transfs'</B>. The bodies array may contain duplicates. Instancing transforms may
contain reflection, translation and rotation but not perspective terms.
If an instance does not need to be transformed, its <B>'transfs'</B> entry can be
set to PK_ENTITY_null.

<B>'topols'</B> returns the edges or faces of these curves.
    An edge is returned when it coincides with an edge.
    A face is returned when its outline is a silhouette curve of that face.
See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.038.html#50409820_pgfId-309049">Returning topological entities</A> for more information.

The one or more outlines of the body or bodies are represented by the curves
and their intervals which make up the boundary(s) of the body(s) if they were
spun around the spin axis. The curves are returned as a set of ordered curves
such that the body, when spun around the spin axis, lies to the left of the
curve when looking in the direction of the curve. When two or more bodies
overlap when spun around the spin axis , the outline will be that of the
combination of the bodies.

<B>'outlines'</B> returns a set of integers indicating which curves belong to which
outline. For instance if this function was used on a body with a hole in it
and 9 curves were returned, 5 of which belonged to the outer outline and 4 to
the inner outline then <B>'outlines'</B> would return ( 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ).

Note: Where the function returns several outlines the order of those outlines
is undefined.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.038.html#50409820_pgfId-309140">Differentiating between several outlines</A> for more information.

<B>'curve_tolerances'</B> returns the accuracy to which each curve represents the
outline.

When modelling with tolerant bodies the curves will meet to tolerance and gaps
may occur. <B>'max_separation'</B> will return the largest gap between the ends of
the adjacent curves.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.038.html#50409820_pgfId-390153">Creating outline curves and spun outlines</A> for more information.
