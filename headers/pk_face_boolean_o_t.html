Description of fields:



<B>'function'</B>               Indicates whether an intersect, unite or subtract
                         operation is to be performed, permitted values
                         are

                         PK_boolean_intersect_c
                         PK_boolean_subtract_c
                         PK_boolean_unite_c



<B>'configuration'</B>          Describes the configuration of target and tool
                         bodies.
                         See <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_config_o_t.html>PK_boolean_config_o_t</A> and #Optimizing boolean
                         operations#DOC0097# for more information.


<B>'select_region'</B>          Used to identify regions of the tool and/or target to
                         include or exclude in the result. This is ignored by
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_face_instance_tools.html>PK_FACE_instance_tools</A> in cases of more than one
                         instance, except if all of the <B>'configuration'</B>
                         options are set to true.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-394027">Select regions in boolean operations</A>
                         for more information.


<B>'matched_region'</B>         Describes matched regions between the target and tool
                         bodies.
                         See <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_match_o_t.html>PK_boolean_match_o_t</A> and <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-394571">here</A> for more
                         information.


<B>'extend_face_list'</B>       A face boolean receives a subset of the faces of a
                         target/tool body. If the imprinting of the boolean
                         results in incomplete loops of imprinted edges, the
                         face list of the target or tool may be extended so
                         that additional faces will be intersected with the
                         tool or target. Additional faces can be added on to
                         the tool or the target or on to both the tool and
                         the target as specified.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-395476">here</A> for more information.


<B>'stop_self_intersection'</B> Stop self intersection, after imprinting, tool faces
                         which will survive the boolean are then compared
                         against all faces of the target body.


<B>'tracking'</B>               Request additional topological data on the result
                         of the boolean, this is specific to the function
                         being called.


<B>'merge_imprinted'</B>        Merge all mergeable imprinted edges created and/or
                         located by the boolean operation. Note that an
                         existing edge can be considered an imprinted edge
                         if it forms part of the intersection between faces
                         from the target and tool.


<B>'fence'</B>                  To determine which resultant bodies are returned when
                         performing solid/sheet (trimming) or sheet/solid
                         (punching) boolean operations.
                         Permitted values are :
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_fence_t.html>PK_boolean_fence_front_c</A>
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_fence_t.html>PK_boolean_fence_back_c</A>
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_fence_t.html>PK_boolean_fence_none_c</A>
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-395588">Effect of the fence option</A> for more
                         information.


<B>'allow_disjoint'</B>         If this option is set to PK_LOGICAL_true, the result
                         of the boolean will be a single body which may contain
                         disjoint manifold components.
                         This option is ignored when a solid target and sheet
                         tool body are specified for a subtract operation and
                         the <B>'fence'</B> option is specified with a value of
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_fence_t.html>PK_boolean_fence_none_c</A>, the <B>'target_material_side'</B>
                         and <B>'tool_material_side'</B> options are set to
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_default_c</A> and the
                         <B>'resulting_body_type'</B> option is set to
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_prefer_t.html>PK_boolean_prefer_original_c</A>.


<B>'selective_merge'</B>        If this is set to PK_LOGICAL_true, the merge phase
                         will avoid merging imprinted edges that existed
                         and were mergeable before the start of the boolean.
                         This flag has no effect if <B>'merge_imprinted'</B> is not
                         set to PK_LOGICAL_true.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.054.html#50409838_pgfId-918743">Effect of merge options</A> for more
                         information.


<B>'check_fa'</B>               The value of this determines if face checking is
                         performed during the operation, permitted values
                         are :

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_check_fa_t.html>PK_boolean_check_fa_no_c</A>
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_check_fa_t.html>PK_boolean_check_fa_yes_c</A>

                         The default is set to <B>'<A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_check_fa_t.html>PK_boolean_check_fa_yes_c</A>'</B>
                         and it is strongly advised not to change this value.
                         If the face checking is switched off, the boolean
                         operation may produce an invalid body without
                         raising an error.


<B>'default_tol'</B>            The default tolerance to which the boolean
                         operation, if it has to, may approximate entities
                         or assume that entities are coincident. This value
                         should be set to a value that is related to the
                         tolerance to which the application is creating
                         approximations.
                         If this field is set to zero (0.0), it is assumed
                         that the decision to set tolerances on entities is
                         being left to the modeller.


<B>'max_tol'</B>                This value specifies the maximum tolerance which may
                         be applied to any entity involved in the boolean
                         operation.
                         If this field is set to zero (0.0), the default, then
                         it assumed that no upper limit has been set on the
                         tolerance of any entity.
                         If the field is not set to zero (0.0), then it must be
                         set to a value that is greater than the value of the
                         <B>'default_tol'</B> field.


<B>'merge_attributes'</B>       If this is set to PK_LOGICAL_true, then any situation
                         in which two coincident faces are combined to result
                         in a face in a result body, will be treated as a
                         <B>'merge'</B> event from the point of view of attribute
                         processing and attribute callbacks. If it is set to
                         PK_LOGICAL_false, which is the default, then such a
                         situation will be treated as the deletion of one of
                         the faces.


<B>'keep_target_edges'</B>      This option controls which edge survives when a
                         target edge and a tool edge coincide in a boolean. If
                         both faces adjacent to the tool edge survive, then the
                         tool edge will also survive. Otherwise, the result
                         depends on the setting of the option:

                         PK_LOGICAL_true:
                             The target edge survives, unless the target edge
                             is a new edge imprinted during the boolean, and
                             the tool edge is an original edge - in this case,
                             the tool edge survives.

                         PK_LOGICAL_false (the default):
                             The older edge (i.e. the one with the smaller tag)
                             survives.

                         This option only has an effect if general topology
                         is disabled. If it is enabled, then the target edge
                         will always survive, even if it is a newly imprinted
                         edge.


<B>'imprint_complete_targ'</B>  This option controls whether to complete the imprint
                         on the target faces so that the end vertices of the
                         imprint lie on any edge or laminar edge of the target
                         faces.  This imprint completion is carried out during
                         the imprinting phase of the boolean algorithm
                         (described in <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_boolean_2.html>PK_BODY_boolean_2</A>).

                         If this is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_no_c</A> (the
                         default) the imprint is not completed.  Otherwise the
                         incomplete imprint is completed by intersecting the
                         target faces with a plane orthogonal to the target at
                         the end vertices of the incomplete imprint.
                         Depending on the value of this option, the imprint
                         will be completed along the direction of this plane
                         until it either:
                           - meets any edge belonging to the target faces
                               (<A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_edge_c</A>), or
                           - meets any laminar edge belonging to the target
                               faces (<A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_laminar_c</A>), or
                           - reaches the boundary of the list of input faces
                               provided, or if <B>'extend_face_list'</B> is set, the
                               boundary of the extended list of faces
                               (<A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_faceset_c</A>)

                         Both the target and tool bodies must be manifold sheet
                         bodies.

                         A complete imprint that self-intersects will be
                         trimmed at the point of self-intersection.

                         Imprint completion on the target faces will only
                         occur from laminar edges of the tool.

                         Restriction: The orientation of the plane is currently
                         restricted to that which would be produced by
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_extend_t.html>PK_imprint_extend_tangent_c</A>.

<B>'imprint_complete_tool'</B>  This option controls whether to complete the imprint
                         on the tool faces in a manner similar to that
                         described for <B>'imprint_complete_targ'</B> above.

                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-466974">here</A> for more information.


<B>'target_material_side'</B>   This option allows the material side of the target
                         faces to be specified when determining which faces
                         survive the given Boolean.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_inside_c</A>:
                             All faces are treated as if their face normals
                             point away from solid material.
                             This allows a sheet body to be treated locally as
                             the boundary of a solid; treatment of faces from
                             solid bodies will be unchanged.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_none_c</A>:
                             All faces are treated as if they have no solid
                             material on either side.
                             This allows a solid body to be treated locally as
                             a sheet; treatment of faces from sheet bodies will
                             be unchanged.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_outside_c</A>:
                             All faces are treated as if their face normals
                             point into solid material.
                             This allows a sheet body to be treated locally as
                             the boundary of a solid; solid bodies will be
                             negated.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_default_c</A> (the default):
                             Faces from solid bodies have normals pointing away
                             from solid material; faces from sheet bodies will
                             have material on neither side.

                         This option is only supported if general topology is
                         disabled.

                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-395829">here</A> for more information.


<B>'tool_material_side'</B>     This option allows the material side of the tool
                         faces to be specified when determining which faces
                         survive the given Boolean.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_inside_c</A>:
                             All faces are treated as if their face normals
                             point away from solid material.
                             This allows a sheet body to be treated locally as
                             the boundary of a solid; treatment of faces from
                             solid bodies will be unchanged.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_none_c</A>:
                             All faces are treated as if they have no solid
                             material on either side.
                             This allows a solid body to be treated locally as
                             a sheet; treatment of faces from sheet bodies will
                             be unchanged.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_outside_c</A>:
                             All faces are treated as if their face normals
                             point into solid material.
                             This allows a sheet body to be treated locally as
                             the boundary of a solid; solid bodies will be
                             negated.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_default_c</A> (the default):
                             Faces from solid bodies have normals pointing away
                             from solid material; faces from sheet bodies will
                             have material on neither side.

                         This option is only supported if general topology is
                         disabled.

<B>'resulting_body_type'</B>    This option allows the preferred type of the
                         resulting body to be indicated.  Only the
                         following values are allowed:

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_prefer_t.html>PK_boolean_prefer_solid_c</A>:
                             If possible the results of the Boolean operation
                             will be solid bodies.  The result will only be
                             made solid if all shells in the result are closed.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_prefer_t.html>PK_boolean_prefer_sheet_c</A>:
                             If possible the results of the Boolean operation
                             will be sheet bodies.  The result may contain
                             several components, if <B>'allow_disjoint'</B> is set to
                             PK_LOGICAL_false then the components will be
                             split out into separate bodies.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_prefer_t.html>PK_boolean_prefer_original_c</A> (the default):
                             The resulting bodies will be of the same type as
                             the target body.  If it is not possible to return
                             a body of the desired type an appropriate error
                             will be returned.

                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-396622">here</A> for more information.

                         If the <B>'fence'</B> option is not <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_fence_t.html>PK_boolean_fence_none_c</A>
                         this option must be set to

<B>'limit_target_faces'</B>     This option limits the faces to be deleted. It
                         is particularly useful when the operation is a
                         trim of the target.

                         PK_LOGICAL_true:
                             The boundary of the target face set is used to
                             complete the imprint and limits the face set
                             to be deleted. It should be noted that the
                             target face set will include faces added by any
                             requested face list extension during the initial
                             phase of imprinting.

                         PK_LOGICAL_false (the default):
                             No limits are imposed upon the region to be
                             deleted.

                         This option can only be used with a limited
                         set of operations.

                         For more information, see <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-395331">here</A>.


<B>'flag_no_effect'</B>         This option allows the user to specify that if it is
                         possible to determine that the original target body
                         is unaffected by the tools, the returned token
                         will be <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_result_t.html>PK_boolean_result_no_effect_c</A>, in
                         preference to <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_result_t.html>PK_boolean_result_success_c</A>.

                             <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_result_t.html>PK_boolean_result_no_effect_c</A> is returned in
                             the same cases as V16.1 and earlier.

                             whenever possible to determine with certainty
                             that the target is unchanged by the tools.
                             This option considers a body is unchanged when
                             all the following conditions apply:
                              - the body occupies the same area/volume
                              - no additional topology or geometry has been
                                imprinted
                              - the body type is unchanged.



<B>'limit_tool_faces'</B>       This option limits the faces to be deleted.

                         PK_LOGICAL_true:
                             The boundary of the tool face set is used to
                             complete the imprint and limits the face set
                             to be deleted. It should be noted that the tool
                             face set will include faces added by any
                             requested face list extension during the
                             initial phase of imprinting.

                         PK_LOGICAL_false (the default):
                             No limits are imposed upon the region to be
                             deleted.

                         This option can only be used with a limited
                         set of operations.

                         For more information, see <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-395331">here</A>.


<B>'tracking_type'</B>          This option allows the user to specify the level
                         of information they wish tracking records to
                         contain. The levels of tracking available are:

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_track_type_t.html>PK_boolean_track_type_basic_c</A>:
                             (Default).
                             Tracking records are compatible with v17.1
                             and earlier. Tracking records associated with
                             edges generated by imprint completion contain
                             information regarding the original topology
                             upon which they are imprinted only.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_track_type_t.html>PK_boolean_track_type_comp_c</A>:
                             Returns enhanced information regarding edges
                             generated by imprint completion. Tracking
                             records for edges generated by imprint
                             completion contain information regarding the
                             original topology upon which they are
                             imprinted; additionally implied information
                             regarding the topology on the other body is
                             included. This is the topology on the other body
                             which caused the imprint from which completion
                             is occurring.


<B>'target_face_overflow'</B>   This option allows the user to specify the method
                         of overflowing the imprint from the target body onto
                         the tool body when overflowing a laminar edge of the
                         target body and overflow imprinting is chosen.
                         This option is only supported if
                         <B>'imprint_complete_tool'</B> is set to
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_no_c</A>.


<B>'tool_face_overflow'</B>     This option allows the user to specify the method
                         of overflowing the imprint from the tool body onto
                         the target body when overflowing a laminar edge of
                         the tool body and overflow imprinting is chosen.
                         This option is only supported if
                         <B>'imprint_complete_targ'</B> is set to
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_no_c</A>.


<B>'update'</B>                 The default value allows applications to take
                         advantage of the latest enhancements to the boolean
                         algorithm. To maintain consistency when rebuilding
                         models created in a previous version of Parasolid, a
                         non-default value should be specified.
                         (<A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_update_t.html>PK_boolean_update_default_c</A>)

Restrictions:
The following options are not currently implemented for
<A HREF=../headers/pk_face_instance_tools.html>PK_FACE_instance_tools</A>:
    <B>'select_region'</B>
    <B>'target_material_side'</B>
    <B>'tool_material_side'</B>
    <B>'resulting_body_type'</B>
    <B>'limit_target_faces'</B>
    <B>'limit_tool_faces'</B>
    <B>'target_face_overflow'</B>
    <B>'tool_face_overflow'</B>

The <B>'tool_material_side'</B> option must be set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_default_c</A>
if the tool faces are not all from the same body.
