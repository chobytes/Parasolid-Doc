The option structure allows the caller to control how the position vectors
on the curve are determined.

Notation: The "start point" of the curve is the position vector corresponding
          to evaluating the curve at the lower boundary of the supplied
          interval <B>'t_int'</B>.
          The "end point" of the curve is the position vector corresponding
          to evaluating the curve at the upper boundary of the supplied
          interval <B>'t_int'</B>.
          The "bounded length" of the curve is the length of the curve measured
          along the curve from the start point to the end point.

n_measurements:
---------------

The number of values supplied in <B>'measurements'</B>.


measurements:
-------------

The values supplied are either distances or ratios of distances measured in
3-space. If they are distance measurements they may neither be negative nor
exceed the length of their reference object ( see below ). If they are ratios
they may neither be negative nor greater than 1.


measurement_method:
-------------------
This enum determines what the values in <B>'measurements'</B> represent.
<B>'measurement_method'</B> can be set to one of:

<A HREF=../headers/pk_measure_t.html>PK_measure_distance_c</A>
    All values in <B>'measurements'</B> are distances measured along the curve from
    the start point.
    For each distance in <B>'measurements'</B> a position vector will be returned
    such that the distance along the curve from the start point to the
    position vector equals the given distance.
    Note that no position vector will be returned for values in
    <B>'measurements'</B> that are negative or larger than the bounded length of the
    curve.


<A HREF=../headers/pk_measure_t.html>PK_measure_distance_ratio_c</A>
    All values in <B>'measurements'</B> are ratios of distances measured along the
    curve from the start point to the bounded length of the curve.
    For each ratio of distances in <B>'measurements'</B> a position vector will be
    returned such that the ratio of the distance along the curve from the
    start point to the position vector to the bounded length of the curve
    equals the given ratio.
    Note that no position vector will be returned for values in
    <B>'measurements'</B> that are negative or larger than 1.


<A HREF=../headers/pk_measure_t.html>PK_measure_chord_c</A>
    The chord is the straight line from the start point to the end point.
    All values in <B>'measurements'</B> are distances measured along the chord
    from the start point.
    For each distance in <B>'measurements'</B> all position vectors on the curve
    that satisfy the following condition will be returned:
        they lie
        i)  on the curve between the start and end points
        AND
        ii) in the plane which is orthogonal to the chord and which is
            located at the given distance from the start point.

    Note that there may be several position vectors returned for each value
    in <B>'measurements'</B>.
    Furthermore, no position vector will be returned for values in
    <B>'measurements'</B> that are negative or larger than the length of the
    chord.


<A HREF=../headers/pk_measure_t.html>PK_measure_chord_ratio_c</A>
    The chord is the straight line from the start point to the end point.
    All values in <B>'measurements'</B> are ratios of distances measured along the
    chord from the start point to the bounded length of the chord.
    For each ratio in <B>'measurements'</B> all position vectors on the curve
    that satisfy the following condition will be returned:
        they lie
        i)  on the curve between the start and end points
        AND
        ii) in the plane which is orthogonal to the chord and which is
            located at a distance from the start point such that the ratio
            of this distance to the bounded length of the chord equals the
            given ratio.

    Note that there may be several position vectors returned for each value
    in <B>'measurements'</B>.
    Furthermore, no position vector will be returned for values in
    <B>'measurements'</B> that are negative or larger than 1.


<A HREF=../headers/pk_measure_t.html>PK_measure_2_chords_ratio_c</A>
    Let P be any point on the curve. Let A be the length of the chord from
    the start point to P, and let B be the length of the chord from P to
    the end point.
    All values in <B>'measurements'</B> are ratios A / ( A + B ).
    For each ratio in <B>'measurements'</B> all position vectors S on the curve
    that satisfy the following condition will be returned:
        i)  S lies on the curve between the start and end points
        AND
        ii) the ratio of the lengths of the chord from the start point
            to S to the bounded length of the two chords from the start
            point to S and from S to the end point is equal to the given
            ratio.

    Note that there may be several position vectors returned for each value
    in <B>'measurements'</B>.
    Furthermore, no position vector will be returned for values in
    <B>'measurements'</B> that are negative or larger than 1.


In general the computational cost of the methods involving chord measurements
is lower than the methods involving true curve lengths or ratios of such.


error_on_failure:
-----------------
This enum determines when the error PK_ERROR_cant_get_vectors will be
returned. It can be set to:

    <A HREF=../headers/pk_error_on_fail_t.html>PK_ERROR_on_fail_any_c</A>
    The error PK_ERROR_cant_get_vectors will be returned unless the
    operation is successful for all values in <B>'measurements'</B>.

    <A HREF=../headers/pk_error_on_fail_t.html>PK_ERROR_on_fail_all_c</A>
    The error PK_ERROR_cant_get_vectors will be returned if the
    operation is successful for none of the values in <B>'measurements'</B>.

    <A HREF=../headers/pk_error_on_fail_t.html>PK_ERROR_on_fail_no_c</A>
    The error PK_ERROR_cant_get_vectors will not be returned.
