See also <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.065.html#50409851_pgfId-300966">Local Ops: Deleting Faces and Healing Wounds</A> for more
information.

All of the given faces, which must belong to the same body, are deleted from
that body.  If the resulting body does not have a complete boundary, then any
holes are treated as wounds which are healed as specified by <B>'heal_action'</B>.
This may take the values:

    PK_FACE_heal_no_c               don't heal wounds - leave rubber faces
    PK_FACE_heal_cap_c              find a surface in which all edges of a hole
                                    lie and attach this to a face covering the
                                    hole
    PK_FACE_heal_grow_from_parent_c grow the faces the parent had around the
                                    hole until they cover it
    PK_FACE_heal_shrink_c           if extending faces does not yield a
                                    solution, then shrinking the faces is tried

The <B>'local_check'</B> argument specifies whether checks on newly created
topological and geometrical entities are to be performed, and the
<B>'check_results'</B> argument returns the result of such checks on each body.
<B>'check_results'</B> may take the values:

    <A HREF=../headers/pk_local_check_t.html>PK_local_check_no_c</A>             local checking not performed either because
                                    <B>'local_check'</B> was PK_LOGICAL_false or
                                    <B>'heal_action'</B> was PK_FACE_heal_no_c
    <A HREF=../headers/pk_local_check_t.html>PK_local_check_ok_c</A>             <B>'body'</B> passes local checks
    <A HREF=../headers/pk_local_check_t.html>PK_local_check_negated_c</A>        as initially created, <B>'body'</B> was inside out
                                    but it has been negated and is now valid
    <A HREF=../headers/pk_local_check_t.html>PK_local_check_failed_c</A>         body fails local checks - it is
                                    self-intersecting

Rubber faces can not be grown to heal other wounds.

This function will not operate on faces from a general body.

If <B>'heal_loops'</B> is set to PK_FACE_heal_loops_separate_c, then each closed loop
of the wound face is healed independently.
If <B>'heal_loops'</B> is set to PK_FACE_heal_loops_together_c, then the loops of the
wound are healed together.
If <B>'heal_loops'</B> is set to PK_FACE_heal_loops_auto_c, then the loops of the
wound are healed either together or separate as appropriate.

Healing loops separately can cause the original body to be split into more
than one <B>'bodies'</B>.

The faces may not form the shell of a sheet body, or the outer shell of a solid
body, but may form an inner shell of a solid body, in which case the shell is
deleted.
