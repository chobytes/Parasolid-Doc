A topolset is a connected set of solid regions and boundary regions which lies
wholly inside or outside the other body. (Tool faces which intersect the
target body are split by the boolean; the resultant faces lie wholly inside
or outside the target body. The same is true of the target with respect to
the tool.)

Each topolset is identified by a single solid region, face, edge, or vertex
which is a member of it; these identifying topologies are known as <B>'selectors'</B>.
In cases where a selector is split by the boolean, a help point may be given
to specify which portion of the selector is intended.

Topolsets from the target and/or tool bodies may be excluded or included as
specified by the <B>'select_type'</B>. The following restrictions are imposed:

 o The selected topolsets from the target are either all excluded or all
   included. It is not possible to exclude some selected topolsets from the
   target and include others. The same also applies to the tool(s): the
   selected topolsets from (all) the tool(s) are either all excluded or all
   included. However since the selector types for the target and tool(s) are
   independent of each other, it is possible to exclude all the selected
   topolsets from the target and include all the selected topolsets from the
   tool(s), or vice versa.

 o Excluding a topolset means that it will be ignored for the purposes of the
   Boolean operation. The Boolean will proceed as though the excluded topolset
   did not exist. Other non-selected topolsets of the same type will be
   treated as normal; they will be included in the Boolean operation. The same
   is also true in reverse; including a topolset means automatically
   excluding all non-selected topolsets of the same type from the Boolean. For
   example, if there are several topolsets derived only from the target, and
   only one of them is selected, and target_select is set to
   <A HREF=../headers/pk_selector_type_t.html>PK_selector_type_include_c</A>, then the other non-selected topolsets derived
   only from the target will automatically be excluded from the Boolean
   operation.

 o Each selector must unambiguously identify a topolset. Where this is not
   possible (i.e. where a selector topology is split by the imprint), there
   are two options. Setting the <B>'split_action'</B> to
   <A HREF=../headers/pk_selector_split_t.html>PK_selector_split_propagate_c</A> will select all the topological entities
   derived from the selector topology. Alternatively, an associated help point
   for the ambiguous selector may be provided in <B>'help_points'</B>. The help point
   must lie within the interior and not on the boundary of its selector
   topology and, if the Boolean splits the selector topology, the help point
   must lie within the interior and not on the boundary of one of the
   selector topology's offspring.  If these conditions are not met the function
   will fail with the error PK_ERROR_bad_position. The value of <B>'split_action'</B>
   will be ignored for a selector if a help point is set for that selector.

 o Depending on which Boolean function is being called, only certain topolsets
   may be selected to exclude or include.

   o For a unite operation, a selector determines whether a topolset derived
     only from the target or only from the tool will survive, and an error
     will be returned if it does not define such a topolset. The topolset will
     not survive if excluded.

   o For an intersect operation, a selector determines whether a topolset
     derived from both the target and the tool will survive, and an error will
     be returned if it does not define such a topolset. The same topolset
     could be indicated by a selector on either the target or the tool. The
     topolset will not survive if excluded.

   o For a subtract operation, a selector on the target determines whether a
     topolset derived from only the target will survive, and an error will be
     returned if it does not define such a topolset. The topolset will not
     survive if excluded. A selector on the tool determines whether a topolset
     derived from both the target and tool will be deleted, and an error will
     be returned if it does not define such a topolset. The topolset will not
     be removed from the target if excluded.

   If a selector is chosen that corresponds to an unsuitable topolset for the
   Boolean function being called, a PK_ERROR_unsuitable_topology error will be
   returned, with the tag of the unsuitable selector as the error entity.
   This tag may be dead, i.e. the selector topology may have been deleted
   during the operation. However the Parasolid session must be rolled back
   after a serious error such as this one, so the tag will be live again after
   the rollback has been performed.

Description of fields:



<B>'n_selectors'</B>        The number of selector topologies supplied.


<B>'selectors'</B>          Topological entities which each uniquely identify a
                     topolset. The array may contain a mixture of solid
                     regions, faces, edges, and vertices, but no other types.
                     The first <B>'n_help_points'</B> entries in the array are
                     associated with their corresponding entries in
                     <B>'help_points'</B>.


<B>'n_help_points'</B>      The number of help points supplied. This may be any
                     number between zero and <B>'n_selectors'</B>.


<B>'help_points'</B>        Help points (vectors) which, when combined with the
                     appropriate topological entity from the <B>'selectors'</B> array,
                     each unambiguously identify a unique topolset. If no
                     help points are required, this array may be NULL. Up
                     to <B>'n_selectors'</B> help points may be supplied, one for
                     each selector that requires a help point.


<B>'target_select'</B>      Indicates whether to exclude or include the selected
                     topolsets from the target body. Permitted values are

                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_selector_type_t.html>PK_selector_type_exclude_c</A>
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_selector_type_t.html>PK_selector_type_include_c</A>
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_selector_type_t.html>PK_selector_type_off_c</A>


<B>'tool_select'</B>        Indicates whether to exclude or include the selected
                     topolsets from the tool body. Permitted values are

                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_selector_type_t.html>PK_selector_type_exclude_c</A>
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_selector_type_t.html>PK_selector_type_include_c</A>
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_selector_type_t.html>PK_selector_type_off_c</A>


<B>'split_action'</B>       Indicates what action should be taken if a selector
                     with no associated help point is split by the boolean.
                     Permitted values are

                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_selector_split_t.html>PK_selector_split_fail_c</A>
                     <A HREF=../headers/pk_selector_split_t.html>PK_selector_split_propagate_c</A>

                     Propagate means that all topological entities derived
                     from the selector after the split are selected.
