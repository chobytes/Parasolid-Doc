All geometry of the given faces is replaced by the given geometry
in <B>'surfs'</B>. The geometry of the edges and vertices connected to
the modified faces will be deleted and recalculated.

Where edges are adjacent to faces whose geometry is being replaced,
the edge curves are re-computed as the intersection of the face
surfaces.

Where edges or faces (sharing a vertex or edge at the boundary of the
faces to be modified) have geometry which is inextendable, it may not
be possible to recalculate vertices or edges. This is because the curve
or surface do not intersect the new surface. If such edges have a user
defined tolerance, this is likely to occur since SP-curves are
inextendable.

If the given faces are on a sheet body, they must not share an edge with
any rubber faces.


Surface Orientation

The orientation of each input surface is assumed to be compatible with
the face whose surface is being replaced. This implies that the normal
of the input surface must be in a direction that ensures the loops of
the face are still valid.

Once the new surface is attached to the face, the loop directions of the
face must still be valid with respect to the new face normal. The geometry
of the loop will have to be recalculated, but the loop direction must
remain the same for the operation to succeed.


Returned Check Status

If local checking is on, consistency checks will be made on newly
created topological and geometrical entities, and the result of
the local check on the body returned via <B>'check_result'</B> :

 o <A HREF=../headers/pk_local_check_t.html>PK_local_check_ok_c</A>       indicates the body is valid.

 o <A HREF=../headers/pk_local_check_t.html>PK_local_check_no_c</A>       indicates that local checking is
                             switched off.

 o <A HREF=../headers/pk_local_check_t.html>PK_local_check_failed_c</A>   indicates the body is invalid and
                             further modelling operations on it
                             may fail. It is the responsibility
                             of the calling routine to make any
                             necessary reparation.
