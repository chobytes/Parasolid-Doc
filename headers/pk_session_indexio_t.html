Description of fields:


<B>'ffoprd'</B>        This routine opens the FFBNRY file specified by its <B>'name'</B>
                argument and stores any required information in its <B>'context'</B>.
                As used by <A HREF=../headers/pk_part_receive.html>PK_PART_receive</A>, <B>'guise'</B> will be FFCXMT or FFCXMP.
                The file pointer on return from this call is deemed to be zero.


<B>'ffopwr'</B>        This routine opens the file specified by its <B>'name'</B> argument,
                as format FFBNRY, and stores any required information in
                its <B>'context'</B>. As used by <A HREF=../headers/pk_part_transmit.html>PK_PART_transmit</A>, <B>'guise'</B> will be
                FFCXMT; used by <A HREF=../headers/pk_partition_transmit.html>PK_PARTITION_transmit</A>, <B>'guise'</B> will be
                FFCXMP. The file pointer on return from this call is deemed
                to be zero.


<B>'ucoprd'</B>        This routine opens the FFBNRY file specified by its <B>'name'</B>
                argument and stores any required information in its <B>'context'</B>.
                As used by <A HREF=../headers/pk_part_receive_u.html>PK_PART_receive_u</A>, <B>'guise'</B> will be FFCXMT or FFCXMP.
                The file pointer on return from this call is deemed to be zero.


<B>'ucopwr'</B>        This routine opens the file specified by its <B>'name'</B> argument
                as format FFBNRY, and stores any required information in
                its <B>'context'</B>. As used by <A HREF=../headers/pk_part_transmit_u.html>PK_PART_transmit_u</A>, <B>'guise'</B> will be
                FFCXMT; used by <A HREF=../headers/pk_partition_transmit_u.html>PK_PARTITION_transmit_u</A>, <B>'guise'</B> will be
                FFCXMP. The file pointer on return from this call is deemed
                to be zero.


<B>'ffread'</B>        This routine reads from file (starting at the current position
                of the file pointer) storing a maximum of nmax bytes in the
                given buffer and returning the actual number of bytes read
                as *nactual. The file pointer is incremented by the number of
                bytes read. If the routine is only able to read a maximum of N
                bytes (where 0 &lt; N &lt; nmax) Parasolid will make follow-up calls
                to <B>'ffread'</B>. If <B>'ffread'</B> reads at least 1 character the return
                code is set to FR_no_errors (or possibly FR_read_fail). The
                code FR_end_of_file is only returned when no bytes have been
                read.


<B>'ffwrit'</B>        This routine writes the given bytes to file, starting at the
                current file position. The file pointer is incremented by the
                number of bytes written.


<B>'ffseek'</B>        This routine resets the file pointer within the file to a
                position relative to the assumed zero position after the call
                to open the file. Subsequent reading or writing will start
                from this position.


<B>'ffclos'</B>        Receive: this routine closes a file which has been opened
                with a call to <B>'ffoprd'</B> or <B>'ucoprd'</B>.
                Transmit: this routine closes a file which has been opened
                with a call to <B>'ffopwr'</B> or <B>'ucopwr'</B>. Parasolid will determine
                whether to retain the file (FFNORM) or to delete it (FFABOR).

Applications may implement their Indexed Frustrum as a thin layer on top of
their existing Frustrum, as the major difference is that the "open for write"
functions create the underlying file for update (e.g., mode "wb+" rather than
"wb"). Then their context can comprise the guise (FFCXMT or FFCXMP), the
Frustrum stream identifier (strid) and the file pointer after successful open;
the latter is then the conversion required between the position passed to
<B>'ffseek'</B> by Parasolid and that in the data held by the Frustrum.
