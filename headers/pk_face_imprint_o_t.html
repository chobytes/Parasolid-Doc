Description of fields:

<B>'imprint_tool'</B>           Imprint edges and vertices on the tool faces.
                         If this flag is set to PK_LOGICAL_false,
                         edges and vertices are imprinted on the
                         target only. The arrays of edges and
                         vertices on the tool, returned in the results
                         structure, will be set to null.

<B>'imprint_overlapping'</B>    Imprint the boundaries of overlapping areas.
                         This is only necessary when the target and
                         tool are faces or sheet bodies. If a face
                         from the target and a face from the tool are
                         on the same surface, the boundaries of the
                         overlapping area will be imprinted. If this
                         flag is not set, faces on a common surface
                         will not imprint on each other.

<B>'matched_region'</B>         Describes matched regions between the target and tool.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-394571">Matched topology in boolean operations</A>
                         for more information.

<B>'extend_face_list'</B>       When imprinting results in incomplete loops
                         of imprinted edges, the face list of the
                         target or tool may be extended so that
                         additional faces will be intersected with the
                         tool or target or both the tool and the target.
                         Additional faces can be added on to the tool or
                         the target or on to both the tool and the
                         target face lists as specified.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-526914">here</A> for more information.

<B>'imprint_complete_targ'</B>  Complete the imprint on the target faces so
                         that the end vertices of the imprint lie on
                         any edge or any laminar edge of the target
                         faces. The incomplete imprint is completed by
                         intersecting the target faces with a plane
                         orthogonal to the target at the end vertices
                         of the incomplete imprint. Depending on the
                         value of this option, the imprint will be
                         completed along the direction of this plane
                         until either:

                         o it meets any edge belonging to the target faces
                         o it meets any laminar edge belonging to the
                           target faces.

                         Tool faces must belong to sheet bodies. Target faces
                         must belong to sheet bodies if completion is to a
                         laminar edge, otherwise they may also belong to solid
                         bodies. A completed imprint that self-intersects
                         will be trimmed at the point of self-intersection.
                         Imprint completion on the target will only occur
                         from laminar edges of the tool.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-526837">Completing imprints</A> for more
                         information.

<B>'imprint_extend_targ'</B>    Choose the orientation of the plane when
                         completing an imprint with
                         <B>'imprint_complete_targ'</B>. The plane may lie
                         tangential or orthogonal to the end of the
                         imprint. The orthogonal direction may lie
                         along the forward or backward direction of the
                         tool face normal at that point.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-526837">Completing imprints</A> for more
                         information.

<B>'imprint_complete_tool'</B>  Complete the imprint on the tool faces. The
                         incomplete imprint will be completed on the
                         tool faces in a manner similar to that described
                         for <B>'imprint_complete_targ'</B> above.  However unlike
                         <B>'imprint_complete_targ'</B> it is not possible for the
                         tool faces to belong to solid bodies.
                         <B>'imprint_tool'</B> must be set to PK_LOGICAL_true
                         when completing an imprint on the tool.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-526837">Completing imprints</A> for more
                         information.

<B>'imprint_extend_tool'</B>    Choose the orientation of the plane when
                         completing an imprint with
                         <B>'imprint_complete_tool'</B>. This option behaves
                         in a similar manner to that described in
                         <B>'imprint_extend_targ'</B>.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-526837">Completing imprints</A> for more
                         information.
