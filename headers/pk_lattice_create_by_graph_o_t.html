The options provided are:

<B>'lballs_estimate'</B>           When positive, an estimate for the total
                            number of lballs that will be returned
                            by all calls to <B>'graph_reader'</B>.

<B>'lrods_estimate'</B>            When positive, an estimate for the total
                            number of lrods that will be returned by
                            all calls to <B>'graph_reader'</B>.

<B>'graph_free'</B>                When not NULL, is a function provided by
                            the application that will free the data
                            returned by <B>'graph_reader'</B>. <B>'graph_free'</B>
                            is called as soon as the application data
                            has been copied into Parasolid's memory,
                            before the next call to <B>'graph_reader'</B>.
                            When <B>'graph_free'</B> is NULL, Parasolid will
                            not attempt to free the memory allocated
                            by the application for the graph blocks.

<B>'thread_safe'</B>               Indicates whether the <B>'graph_reader'</B> callback
                            and the <B>'graph_free'</B> callback (if supplied) are
                            thread safe.

<B>'lball_radius'</B>              The radius of the lballs in the lattices. If no
                            value is provided, the <B>'graph_reader'</B> expects to
                            receive the radius of each lball.

<B>'lball_min_radius'</B>          Controls the behaviour when a supplied lball radius
                            is not as large as the radius of its largest
                            incident lrod.

<B>'lball_blend_type'</B>          If not <A HREF=../headers/pk_lball_blend_t.html>PK_LBALL_blend_none_c</A>, the lattices are
                            blended with blend radii determined by the value of
                            this option, together with either the value of
                            <B>'lball_blend_size'</B> if provided, or the values of
                            <B>'lball_blend_sizes'</B> received by <B>'graph_reader'</B>.

<B>'lball_blend_size'</B>          The size of the lball blends in the lattices. If no
                            value is provided and <B>'lball_blend_type'</B> is not
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_lball_blend_t.html>PK_LBALL_blend_none_c</A>, the <B>'graph_reader'</B> expects
                            to receive the blend size of each lball.

<B>'lrod_shape_opts'</B>           Optional controls on the shape of the lrods of the
                            lattices.

<B>'have_snap_tolerance'</B>       Whether a snapping tolerance value is provided. If
                            this is PK_LOGICAL_true, then <B>'snap_tolerance'</B> sets
                            the maximum distance between lball positions,
                            variation in lball radii, and variation in
                            lball_lrod_radii at which multiple lballs can be
                            snapped together into a single, combined lball. If
                            this is PK_LOGICAL_false, then <B>'snap_tolerance'</B> is
                            ignored and snapping will be performed to session
                            precision.

<B>'snap_tolerance'</B>            The tolerance used for lball snapping.

<B>'require_connected'</B>         If <A HREF=../headers/pk_lattice_connected_t.html>PK_LATTICE_connected_yes_c</A>, any resulting
                            lattices will each be graph-connected. If the data
                            returned by <B>'graph_reader'</B> specifies a disjoint
                            graph, <B>'n_lattices'</B> will be greater than one. If
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_lattice_connected_t.html>PK_LATTICE_connected_no_c</A>, a single lattice will be
                            returned that may be disjoint.

When supplying <B>'lballs_estimate'</B> or <B>'lrods_estimate'</B>, it is recommended
that applications moderately overestimate (by ~20%) the number of lballs
and lrods they will need, as the overhead of allocating additional memory
following an underestimate is more significant than the wasted memory of
an overestimate.
