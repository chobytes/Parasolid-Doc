Description of fields:



<B>'function'</B>               Indicates whether an intersect, unite or subtract
                         operation is to be performed, permitted values are

                         PK_boolean_intersect_c
                         PK_boolean_subtract_c
                         PK_boolean_unite_c



<B>'configuration'</B>          Describes the configuration of target and tool
                         bodies.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-393957">here</A> for more
                         information.


<B>'selected_topolset'</B>      Describes topolsets selected to be excluded from or
                         included in the boolean operation.

                         A topolset is selected by specifying a <B>'selector'</B>
                         topology which lies within that topolset. Selector
                         topologies can be solid regions, faces, edges, or
                         vertices. The selected topolsets can be excluded or
                         included by setting <B>'target_select'</B> and <B>'tool_select'</B>
                         to the appropriate values.

                         See the documentation of
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_select_topolset_o_t.html>PK_boolean_select_topolset_o_t</A> for more information.


<B>'matched_region'</B>         Describes matched regions between the target and tool
                         bodies.
                         See <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_match_o_t.html>PK_boolean_match_o_t</A> and <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.053.html#50409837_pgfId-394571">here</A> for more
                         information.


<B>'merge_imprinted'</B>        Merge all mergeable imprinted edges created and/or
                         located by the boolean operation. Note that an
                         existing edge can be considered an imprinted edge
                         if it forms part of the intersection between faces
                         from the target and tool.


<B>'prune_in_solid'</B>         This option is deprecated and has been superseded by
                         <B>'merge_in_solid'</B>, <B>'merge_in_face'</B>,
                         <B>'merge_in_solid_dimension'</B> and
                         <B>'merge_in_face_dimension'</B>.


<B>'prune_in_void'</B>          Prune void regions of the result. Any faces, edges
                         or vertices in the result body which are completely
                         surrounded by void regions will be deleted, so long
                         as the result body contains some pieces of a higher
                         dimension (for example, a sheet face will only be
                         deleted if the result body contains at least one
                         solid region).
                         This option is only allowed when general topology
                         is enabled.
                         (PK_LOGICAL_false)


<B>'fence'</B>                  To determine which resultant bodies are returned when
                         performing solid/sheet (trimming) or sheet/solid
                         (punching) boolean operations.
                         Permitted values are :

                         information.


<B>'allow_disjoint'</B>         If generalised topology is disabled:
                         If this option is set to PK_LOGICAL_true,
                         the result of the boolean will usually be
                         a single body which may contain disjoint
                         manifold components.

                         This option is ignored when a solid target
                         and sheet tool body are specified for a subtract
                         operation and the <B>'fence'</B> option is specified
                         with a value of <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_fence_t.html>PK_boolean_fence_none_c</A>, the
                         <B>'target_material_side'</B> and <B>'tool_material_side'</B>
                         options are set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_default_c</A>
                         and the <B>'resulting_body_type'</B> option is set to
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_prefer_t.html>PK_boolean_prefer_original_c</A>.

                         If general topology is enabled this option
                         is ignored.  The result will always be a single
                         body which may contain disjoint components.


<B>'selective_merge'</B>        If this is set to PK_LOGICAL_true, the merge phase
                         will avoid mergeing imprinted edges that existed
                         and were mergeable before the start of the boolean.
                         This flag has no effect if <B>'merge_imprinted'</B> is not
                         set to PK_LOGICAL_true.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.054.html#50409838_pgfId-918743">here</A> for more
                         information.


<B>'check_fa'</B>               The value of this determines if face checking is
                         performed during the operation, permitted values
                         are :

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_check_fa_t.html>PK_boolean_check_fa_no_c</A>
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_check_fa_t.html>PK_boolean_check_fa_yes_c</A>

                         The default is <B>'<A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_check_fa_t.html>PK_boolean_check_fa_yes_c</A>'</B>.
                         If the face checking is switched off, the boolean
                         operation may produce an invalid body without
                         raising an error. However, in some cases, if face
                         checking is switched on the performance of the
                         boolean operation may be reduced.

                         NOTE: This option is inoperative for <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_boolean.html>PK_BODY_boolean</A>.


<B>'default_tol'</B>            The default tolerance to which the boolean
                         operation, if it has to, may approximate entities
                         or assume that entities are coincident. This value
                         should be set to a value that is related to the
                         tolerance to which the application is creating
                         approximations.
                         If this field is set to zero (0.0), it is assumed
                         that the decision to set tolerances on entities is
                         being left to the modeller.


<B>'max_tol'</B>                This value specifies the maximum tolerance which may
                         be applied to any entity involved in the boolean
                         operation.
                         If this field is set to zero (0.0), the default, then
                         it assumed that no upper limit has been set on the
                         tolerance of any entity.
                         If the field is not set to zero (0.0), then it must be
                         set to a value that is greater than the value of the
                         <B>'default_tol'</B> field.


<B>'tracking'</B>               Request additional topological data on the result
                         of the boolean, this is specific to the function
                         being called. Within this function this option
                         can be used to return additional tracking data
                         when using a single, non-disjoint tool body.


<B>'merge_attributes'</B>       If this is set to PK_LOGICAL_true, then any situation
                         in which two coincident faces are combined to result
                         in a face in a result body, will be treated as a
                         <B>'merge'</B> event from the point of view of attribute
                         processing and attribute callbacks. If it is set to
                         PK_LOGICAL_false, which is the default, then such a
                         situation will be treated as the deletion of one of
                         the faces.

                         This option only has an effect if general topology
                         is disabled. If it is enabled, then combining two
                         coincident faces is always treated as a <B>'merge'</B>
                         event.


<B>'keep_target_edges'</B>      This option controls which edge survives when a
                         target edge and a tool edge coincide in a boolean. If
                         both faces adjacent to the tool edge survive, then the
                         tool edge will also survive. Otherwise, the result
                         depends on the setting of the option:

                         PK_LOGICAL_true:
                             The target edge survives, unless the target edge
                             is a new edge imprinted during the boolean, and
                             the tool edge is an original edge - in this case,
                             the tool edge survives.

                         PK_LOGICAL_false (the default):
                             The older edge (i.e. the one with the smaller tag)
                             survives.

                         This option only has an effect if general topology
                         is disabled. If it is enabled, then the target edge
                         will always survive, even if it is a newly imprinted
                         edge.


<B>'imprint_complete_targ'</B>  This option controls whether to complete the imprint
                         on the target body so that the end vertices of the
                         imprint lie on any edge or laminar edge of the target
                         body.  This imprint completion is carried out during
                         the imprinting phase of the face boolean algorithm
                         (the phases of which are essentially the same as in
                         the body boolean algorithm described in
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_boolean_2.html>PK_BODY_boolean_2</A>).

                         If this is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_no_c</A> (the
                         default) the imprint is not completed.  Otherwise the
                         incomplete imprint is completed by intersecting the
                         target body with a plane orthogonal to the target at
                         the end vertices of the incomplete imprint.
                         Depending on the value of this option, the imprint
                         will be completed along the direction of this plane
                         until it either:
                           - meets any edge belonging to the target body
                               (<A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_edge_c</A>), or
                           - meets any laminar edge belonging to the target
                               body (<A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_laminar_c</A>)
                         N.B. The value <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_faceset_c</A> only
                         applies to the face boolean algorithm, so it may not
                         be used here.

                         If the PK function supports imprint completion on
                         general bodies, and general topology is enabled in
                         the session, then imprint completion will stop where
                         the imprint meets a general edge, in addition to the
                         behaviour described above. The completion will also
                         stop where the imprint meets a general vertex, unless
                         it can be continued on the same "manifold piece" of
                         the body, as described in
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_make_manifold_bodies.html>PK_BODY_make_manifold_bodies</A>.

                         Both the target and tool bodies must be manifold sheet
                         bodies unless general topology is enabled in the
                         session.

                         A complete imprint that self-intersects will be
                         trimmed at the point of self-intersection.

                         Imprint completion on the target faces will only
                         occur from laminar edges of the tool.

                         Restriction: The orientation of the plane is currently
                         restricted to that which would be produced by

<B>'imprint_complete_tool'</B>  This option controls whether to complete the imprint
                         on the tool body in a manner similar to that
                         described for <B>'imprint_complete_targ'</B> above.

<B>'target_material_side'</B>   This option allows the material side of the target
                         faces to be specified when determining which faces
                         survive the given Boolean.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_inside_c</A>:
                             All faces are treated as if their face normals
                             point away from solid material.
                             This allows a sheet body to be treated locally as
                             the boundary of a solid; treatment of faces from
                             solid bodies will be unchanged.

                             negated.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_material_t.html>PK_boolean_material_default_c</A> (the default):

                             have material on neither side.

                         This option is only supported if general topology is

                             bodies.  The result may contain several
                             components, if 'allow_disjoint' is set to
                             PK_LOGICAL_false then the components will be
                             split out into separate bodies.

                         PK_TOPOL_dimension_1_c or
                         PK_TOPOL_dimension_any_c: merge out redundant edges
                                                   and isolated vertices
                         (PK_TOPOL_dimension_any_c)


<B>'merge_in_edge'</B>          This determines whether any redundant vertices
                         between edges in the result body which were not
                         redundant in the tool or target bodies should be
                         merged out.
                         This option is only allowed when general topology
                         is enabled.
                         <B>'merge_in_edge'</B> is performed after <B>'merge_in_solid'</B>
                         and <B>'merge_in_face'</B> and so it may merge out
                         vertices which have become redundant through having
                         faces and/or edges merged out during 'merge_in_solid'
                         and 'merge_in_face'.
                         (PK_LOGICAL_false)


<B>'impose_bodies'</B>          To impose one body onto another means that material
                         from the first body dominates material from the
                         second body.  Topologies of the second body located
                         within solid material of the first body are
                         considered redundant and are therefore deleted.  All
                         result regions surrounding these redundant topologies
                         only inherit from the first body.

                         This option controls interactions between the target
                         and the tool(s).  For control of tool-tool
                         interactions, see <B>'merge_tools'</B>.

                         This option is only allowed when general topology
                         is enabled, <B>'function'</B> is PK_boolean_unite_c, and
                         <B>'merge_in_solid'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_false.

                         The possible values are:

                             Neither body imposes, no topologies are deleted.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_boolean_impose_t.html>PK_boolean_impose_target_c</A>:
                             The solid regions of the target are imposed onto
                             the tool(s).
                             Tool topologies are deleted if they are located
                             within the solid material of the target.  Any
                             regions which merge due to this deletion inherit
                             only from their parent region(s) in the target.

                             The solid regions of the tool(s) are imposed onto
                             the target.
                             Target topologies are deleted if they are located
                             within the solid material of the tool(s).  Any
                             regions which merge due to this deletion inherit

<B>'merge_tools'</B>            This option controls merging between interacting tool
                         bodies.

                         This option is only allowed when general topology
                         is enabled, <B>'function'</B> is PK_boolean_unite_c, and
                         <B>'merge_in_solid'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_false.

                         The possible values are:

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_merge_tools_t.html>PK_merge_tools_no_c</A>:
                             Tools are not merged and no topologies are
                             deleted.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_merge_tools_t.html>PK_merge_tools_yes_c</A>:
                             Tools are merged and topologies are deleted if
                             they are located within the solid material of
                             any of the other tools. Any tool faces which
                             would have the same solid region on both sides as
                             a result of the merge are also deleted.
