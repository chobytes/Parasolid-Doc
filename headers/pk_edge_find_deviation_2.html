<A NAME="errors"></A>
<B>Specific Errors:</B>
PK_ERROR_same_edge          Both edges are the same (MILD)

PK_ERROR_missing_geom       One of the edges has no curve geometry on it
                            (MILD)

PK_ERROR_no_overlap         The edges had no overlap(MILD)

PK_ERROR_distancing_failed  Determination of the distances not completed
                            because of algorithmic failure(MILD)

<A NAME="documentation"></A>
PK_EDGE_find_deviation_2 provides distance samples between two edges
received in <B>'edge1'</B> and <B>'edge2'</B>.

Either <B>'edge1'</B> or <B>'edge2'</B> is chosen to be the master edge from which the
distances will be computed.  The selection is made by comparing the
geometry of the two edges to choose the most stable for the distance
calculations.

If successful one or more regions of overlap will be found. If no overlap
is found this results in the error PK_ERROR_no_overlap. Each region may be
extended or point-like.

The function assumes the two edges to present a reasonably parallel pairing
of curve geometries. Edges which differ significantly in direction can
produce non-intuitive results. Understanding these cases can be aided by
bearing in mind that the function seeks a collection of minimising, rather
than stationary, distances from sampled points on the master edge.

The sampling data is returned within a <A HREF=../headers/pk_edge_find_deviation_r_t.html>PK_EDGE_find_deviation_r_t</A> which
contains an array of <A HREF=../headers/pk_edge_find_deviation_t.html>PK_EDGE_find_deviation_t</A>. Each element of this array
corresponds to a region of overlap.
