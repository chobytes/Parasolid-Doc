<A NAME="description"></A>
<I>This function returns the modeller to the state when the given mark was
created.

NOTE: This function is deprecated and has been superseded by <A HREF=../headers/pk_mark_goto_2.html>PK_MARK_goto_2</A>.
</I>
<A NAME="errors"></A>
<B>Specific Errors:</B>
    PK_ERROR_rollback_not_started   Neither PK nor partitioned rollback active
    PK_ERROR_bad_mark               The given mark is invalid
    PK_ERROR_frustrum_failure       (potentially FATAL) The frustrum returned
                                    an error

<A NAME="documentation"></A>
If it is not possible to rollback, the function raises an error, and
leaves the model unchanged, except that in the case of partitioned rollback,
some partitions may have been rolled. If the failure is due to a 'disk full'
error from the frustrum, the application could make more space available
and retry the operation.

In the case of partitioned rollback, the following interface parameters will
be unaffected. Other interface parameters will be rolled back.

    Interface checking on/off
    Journalling on/off
    Roll forward on/off
    Tag limit

A thread that has locked partitions can only roll to marks created in that
thread since its partitions were locked. While there are locked partitions,
threads that do not have locked partitions may not roll to any marks that
were created before those partitions were locked.

If roll forward is off, then all forward marks become invalidated.

This function should only be called when PK rollback has been started
with <A HREF=../headers/pk_mark_start.html>PK_MARK_start</A> or partitioned rollback has been started with
<A HREF=../headers/pk_delta_register_callbacks.html>PK_DELTA_register_callbacks</A>.
