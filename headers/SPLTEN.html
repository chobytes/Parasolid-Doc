SPLTEN ( body, nfaces, faces, new_faces, ifail )
================================================

  Split topology and geometry of body at any G1 discontinuities.

Receives:
  KI_tag_body              *body           --- body

Returns:
 &lt;KI_int_nitems&gt;           *nfaces         --- number of faces that have been split
 &lt;KI_tag_list_face&gt;        *faces          --- list of original faces that were split
 &lt;KI_tag_list_list&gt;        *new_faces      --- list for each new set of faces,
                                           --- corresponding to each of the old faces
  KI_cod_error             *ifail          --- failure indicator

Specific errors:
  KI_cant_extract_geom      failed to extract geom

Description:

  Receives a body ('body'), that maybe invalid due to geometry allocated to
  topology that is not G1 continuous. The faces and edges will be split
  at places where the continuity is G0. Existing geometry will be modified,
  new topology will be created - faces, edges and vertices.

  A curve that is not G1, and lies on a surface that is G1 will be split,
  and the surface left intact.

  'faces' is a list of the original faces on the body that have been split.

  'new_faces' is a list of face lists. Each of the face lists corresponds
  to one of the original faces. For example if a face has discontinuities,
  it will be split and new faces created. The 'face' list will contain the
  tag of the original face, and the element in the 'new_faces' list will
  contain a list of the new face's corresponding tags.
