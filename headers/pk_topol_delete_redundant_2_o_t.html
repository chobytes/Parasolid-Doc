max_topol_dimension   : Specifies what type of topologies should be considered
                        for redundancy. A maximum dimension of
                        PK_TOPOL_dimension_0_c will consider vertices only;
                        one of PK_TOPOL_dimension_1_c will consider edges or
                        vertices. A maximum dimension of
                        PK_TOPOL_dimension_any_c will consider all topologies
                        of dimensionality equal to or less than the the
                        dimensionality of the supplied <B>'topols'</B>; this is the
                        default. The <B>'max_topol_dimension'</B> must not be higher
                        than the dimension of the supplied <B>'topols'</B>.

scope                 : Specifies how the (sub)topologies forming the external
                        boundaries to the input topological set are treated.

facet_geom_continuity : The level of geometric continuity between adjacent
                        facet geometries that is necessary for topology to
                        be considered redundant. It can take the values:

                          o <A HREF=../headers/pk_continuity_t.html>PK_continuity_g0_c</A>
                            All manifold non-laminar edges between, or wire
                            edges in, faces with mesh surfaces are considered
                            redundant. Similarly all manifold vertices between,
                            or on, edges with pline curves are considered
                            redundant unless there are more than two
                            non-redundant edges meeting at them. This is the
                            default.

                          o <A HREF=../headers/pk_continuity_t.html>PK_continuity_g1_c</A>
                            An edge on a facet body will be considered
                            redundant only if the mvertices lying along it
                            will not become sharp when the edge is removed.

                            A vertex between two polyline edges is considered
                            for redundancy only if either edge belongs to the
                            g1 edge chain of the other (this can be tested
                            by calling <A HREF=../headers/pk_edge_find_g1_edges.html>PK_EDGE_find_g1_edges</A> with its
                            <B>'tolerance'</B> set to the same value as the desired
                            <B>'vertex_angle'</B>).

                        Leaving <B>'facet_geom_continuity'</B> at its default of
                        <A HREF=../headers/pk_continuity_t.html>PK_continuity_g0_c</A> is not usually advisable, as it
                        will remove all non-laminar manifold topology from
                        facet bodies, typically resulting in a single face
                        body with a single mesh surface. This can sometimes
                        have a detrimental impact on the performance of
                        subsequent modelling operations.

have_vertex_angle     : Whether a <B>'vertex_angle'</B> has been supplied.

vertex_angle          : The angle to which the <B>'tolerance'</B> should be set in
                        <A HREF=../headers/pk_edge_find_g1_edges.html>PK_EDGE_find_g1_edges</A> in order to determine whether
                        a vertex between two polyline edges will be considered
                        for redundancy. Increasing the <B>'vertex_angle'</B> will
                        typically increase the number of vertices which are
                        considered redundant.

n_protected_topols    : Number of protected topologies.

protected_topols      : Protected topology array. These topologies and their
                        sub-topologies will not be deleted.
