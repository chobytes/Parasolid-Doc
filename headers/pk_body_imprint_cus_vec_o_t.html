Description of fields:



<B>'connect'</B>                Specifies how to connect disjoint components of
                         the imprint. Permitted values are :

information.




<B>'imprint_complete'</B>       Whether to complete the imprint on the body.
                         Vertices in the imprint corresponding to the
                         ends of the imprinted trimmed curves can be
                         completed so that they lie on an edge or laminar
                         edge of the target body.

                         The incomplete imprint is completed by
                         intersecting the faces of the body with a plane
                         tangential to the imprint at the end vertices
                         of the incomplete imprint and orthogonal to the
                         body.

                         Depending on the value of this option, the
                         imprint will be completed along the direction
                         of this plane until either:

                         o it meets any edge belonging to the body
                         o it meets any laminar edge belonging to the
                           body.

                         A completed imprint that self-intersects
                         will be trimmed at the point of self-intersection.
                         Completion to laminar edges may only be performed
                         upon sheet bodies.

                         For more information, see <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-295712">here</A>.


<B>'imprint_coi_exactly'</B>     If <B>'imprint_coi_exactly'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_true
                          then curves coincident with their target surfaces
                          are imprinted exactly where appropriate, rather
                          than being imprinted by projection.
                          See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-296271">here</A> for more information.
                          The default value is PK_LOGICAL_false.


<B>'imprint_exactly'</B>         If <B>'imprint_exactly'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_true
                          then all curves will be imprinted accurately,
                          irrespective of the setting of <B>'imprint_coi_exactly'</B>.
                          See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-296271">here</A> for more information.
                          The default value is PK_LOGICAL_false.


<B>'bidirectional'</B>           If <B>'bidirectional'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_true
                          then all curves will be imprinted in both positive
                          and negative vector direction and edges visible in
                          the view in both directions will be imprinted. If it
                          is set to false then they are only imprinted in the
                          positive direction.
                          The default value is PK_LOGICAL_false.


<B>'process_intersections'</B>   Specifies how to deal with supplied curves that
                          intersect in view (i.e. within a plane perpendicular
                          to the imprint direction vector).
                          Permitted values are:

                          <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_intersect_t.html>PK_imprint_intersect_update_c</A>
                          <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_intersect_t.html>PK_imprint_intersect_fail_c</A>
                          <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_intersect_t.html>PK_imprint_intersect_fix_c</A>

                          The default value is <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_intersect_t.html>PK_imprint_intersect_update_c</A>,
                          which should be used for updating v24.1 and earlier
                          models.
