It has the following fields:

<B>'max_samples'</B>
            Controls the maximum number of samples returned by
            PK_EDGE_deviation_2. The value of <B>'max_samples'</B> produces three
            different sampling behaviours detailed below:

            ----------------------------------------------------------------
            |  Value      |                                                |
            |    of       |                    Behaviour                   |
            |<B>'max_samples'</B>|                                                |
            ----------------------------------------------------------------
            |     0       | <A HREF=../headers/pk_edge_find_deviation_2.html>PK_EDGE_find_deviation_2</A> determines            |
            |             | the appropriate set of points in each region   |
            |             | ( both in number and position. ) Distances are |
            |             | measured and returned at all these points.     |
            ----------------------------------------------------------------
            |     1       | <A HREF=../headers/pk_edge_find_deviation_2.html>PK_EDGE_find_deviation_2</A> chooses the same set  |
            |             | of points as for the case <B>'max_samples'</B> == 0.  |
            |             | However in this case only the pair of points   |
            |             | producing the greatest distance is returned.   |
            ----------------------------------------------------------------
            |   N &gt; 1     | For point-like regions a single sample is      |
            |             | returned. For Extended overlap regions N       |
            |             | samples are returned.                          |
            ----------------------------------------------------------------

<B>'bound_at_split_vertex'</B>
            When the vertex of a split ring edge lies within an overlap
            region, the region may span the vertex, for instance if the
            vertex does not lie at the parameter seam of the periodic edge
            curve.  If this option is set to PK_LOGICAL_true, then such an
            overlap region is adjusted so that the vertex lies at the
            boundary of the region, and may result in the region being split
            into two.  This gives results more similar to those of an open
            edge, where the vertices always bound the overlap regions.

<B>'have_upper_bound'</B>
            An <B>'upper_bound'</B> has been provided.

<B>'upper_bound'</B>
            If an <B>'upper_bound'</B> is provided, PK_EDGE_deviation_2 will not
            return any overlap region which has sample distances
            greater than the <B>'upper_bound'</B>. This may result in no
            overlaps being found.
