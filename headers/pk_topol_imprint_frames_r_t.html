Description of field:

<B>'tracking'</B>  Face tracking
            -------------

            For each frame that produces new facet faces, a record of type
            PK_ENTITY_track_create_c is created.  <B>'original_entities'</B> contains
            the frame and <B>'product_entities'</B> contains the new faces.

            For each original face belonging to an imprinted frame's region,
            one or more records are created.  The number and type of records
            depends on the interaction of the original face with its adjacent
            frames, and also depends on region merging controlled by the
            <B>'grow_void_regions'</B> and <B>'grow_solid_regions'</B> options, as follows:
                o If region merging causes there to be no surviving portions of
                  the original face, a record of type PK_ENTITY_track_delete_c
                  is created.  <B>'original_entities'</B> contains the original face.
                o If any surviving portions of the original face lie outside
                  all of its adjacent frames, a record of type
                  PK_ENTITY_track_derive_c is created.  <B>'original_entities'</B>
                  contains the original face and its original regions on both
                  sides, and <B>'product_entities'</B> contains the face(s) lying
                  outside the adjacent frames.
                o If any surviving portions of the original face lie inside at
                  least one of its adjacent frames, one or more records of type
                  PK_ENTITY_track_derive_c are created.  In each record,
                  <B>'original_entities'</B> contains the original face and a set of
                  one or more overlapping frames adjacent to this face, and
                  <B>'product_entities'</B> contains the face(s) lying inside this set
                  of frames.  If <B>'original_entities'</B> contains frames from only
                  one side of the face, the original region on the opposite
                  side is included in <B>'original_entities'</B>.


            Region tracking
            ---------------

            For each set of overlapping frames (which may be a single frame if
            it is disjoint from all the others) that produces at least one new
            region, a record of type PK_ENTITY_track_create_c is created.
            <B>'original_entities'</B> contains the overlapping frames and
            <B>'product_entities'</B> contains one or more regions that were formed
            from this set of frames.

            For each original region that is split, a record of type
            PK_ENTITY_track_split_c is created.  <B>'original_entities'</B> contains
            the original region and <B>'product_entities'</B> contains two or more
            split regions that lie outside all the original region's frames.

            For each original region that is deleted, a record of type
            PK_ENTITY_track_delete_c is created.  <B>'original_entities'</B> contains
            the deleted region.

            If the <B>'grow_void_regions'</B> or <B>'grow_solid_regions'</B> options cause
            regions to be merged, these merged regions are removed from the
            <B>'product_entities'</B> of any creation or splitting records, and the
            resultant region is added to the <B>'product_entities'</B> of a new
            record.  <B>'original_entities'</B> in the new record contains all the
            <B>'original_entities'</B> from the old records, as well as any merged
            regions that were not created or split.  If any of the merged
            regions were previously split, the new record has type
            PK_ENTITY_track_derive_c, otherwise it has type
            PK_ENTITY_track_merge_c.  Any creation and splitting records that
            have lost all their <B>'product_entities'</B> are deleted.  Any splitting
            records that have a single element remaining in <B>'product_entities'</B>
            are deleted if <B>'product_entities'</B> and <B>'original_entities'</B> are the
            same, otherwise their type is changed to PK_ENTITY_track_derive_c.
