                                   array, other than the body, that has no
                                   parent


<A NAME="documentation"></A>
The array <B>'classes'</B> specifies the class of each topological entity.
The allowed values are:

    PK_CLASS_body
    PK_CLASS_region
    PK_CLASS_shell
    PK_CLASS_face
    PK_CLASS_loop
    PK_CLASS_fin
    PK_CLASS_edge
    PK_CLASS_vertex

Each topological entity is referred to by its index in this array.

All of the body's regions, shells, faces, loops, edges and vertices must be
present in the input.  It is optional whether fins are present.  The
existence of a fin may be inferred from an edge being a child of a loop.

The arrays <B>'parents'</B>, <B>'children'</B> and <B>'senses'</B> are all the same length which
is <B>'n_relations'</B>.
`parents[i]', `children[i]' and `senses[i]' define one relation between
two topological entities.  The values put into <B>'parents'</B> and <B>'children'</B>
are indices of the <B>'classes'</B> array.

The following rules apply to the order of the relations:

 - the child relations to a common parent need not be contiguous.

 - edge or fin children of a loop must appear in order around the loop.

 - vertex children of an edge must appear in the order of the direction of
   the edge.

 - loop or fin children of a non-manifold edge must appear in order around the
   edge

 - the first relation given between the body and a region must refer to
   the body's outer region

<B>'senses'</B> indicate the manner in which a child is used by its parent.  In
relations in which sense matters it should be set to one of:
    PK_TOPOL_sense_positive_c or
    PK_TOPOL_sense_negative_c.
In relation where sense does not matter it should be set to:
    PK_TOPOL_sense_none_c.

The relations in which sense matters are:
  - region as child of body:
    PK_TOPOL_sense_positive_c means region is solid and
    PK_TOPOL_sense_negative_c means region is void
  - face as child of shell:
    PK_TOPOL_sense_positive_c means the face normal points to the interior of
                              the shell and
    PK_TOPOL_sense_negative_c means the face normal points away from the
                              interior of the shell
    As a special case, if a face is child of a shell twice, with each sense
    then this may be expressed in a single relation with the sense set to
    PK_TOPOL_sense_none_c
  - an edge as a child of a fin or loop:
    PK_TOPOL_sense_positive_c means the edge is in the same direction as the
                              fin or loop
    PK_TOPOL_sense_negative_c means the edge is in the opposite direction to
                              the fin or loop
  - a fin or loop as a child of an edge:
    PK_TOPOL_sense_positive_c means the edge is in the same direction as the
                              fin or loop
    PK_TOPOL_sense_negative_c means the edge is in the opposite direction to
                              the fin or loop


The permitted classes and numbers of children and parents are as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Entity    Children      No. of children   Parents     No. of parents
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Body      Regions             &gt;=1           -             -
Region    Shells              &gt;=1         Body            1
Shell     Faces               &gt;=1         Region          1
          Edges               &gt;=1
          Vertex              1
Face      Loops               &gt;=1         Shell           2
Loop      Edges               &gt;=1         Face,Edge       &gt;=1
          Fins                &gt;=1
          Vertex              1
Fin       Edge                1           Loop,Edge       &lt;=2
Edge      Vertices            &lt;=2         Loop,Fin,Shell  1
          Loop                &gt;=1
          Fin                 &gt;=1
Vertex    -                   0           Edge,Loop,Shell &gt;=1
--------------------------------------------------------------------

NB: - Each face must be used twice as a child, once with each sense (this
      may be in the same shell).
    - A loop must have either a number of edges (with senses) as children, or
      a number of fins as children, or a single vertex; it cannot have any
      mixture of edges, fins and vertices, or more than one vertex.
    - a shell may contain a mixture of faces and edges (an edge which is the
      child of a shell is a wireframe edge), but if the shell contains a vertex
      then it must be a single vertex and the shell may not have any faces or
      edges
    - A vertex must have a number of edges as parents, or a number of loops
      or a single shell.

The application may indicate the expected body type in the options structure.
If the given topology is the topology of a body of that type, then the returned
body will be of that type, otherwise the returned body will be of type
PK_BODY_type_general_c.

Success of the function is indicated by there being no PK error returned
and by <B>'fault'</B> being set to PK_BODY_fault_no_fault_c.

If the creation is successful:

 -  the created body is returned in <B>'body'</B>
 -  the entities corresponding to the entries in the <B>'classes'</B> array are
    returned in the <B>'topols'</B> array.

If the creation is unsuccessful but no PK error is returned:

 -  no body is created
 -  a fault indicator is returned in <B>'fault'</B>
    (see documentation for <A HREF=../headers/pk_body_fault_t.html>PK_BODY_fault_t</A>)
 -  the index (in the <B>'classes'</B> array) of the faulty item is returned if
    possible
