Description of fields:



<B>'imprint_complete'</B>        Complete the imprint on the target faces so
                          that the end vertices of the imprint lie on
                          any edge or any laminar edge of the target
                          faces. The incomplete imprint is completed by
                          intersecting the target faces with a plane
                          orthogonal to the target at the end vertices
                          of the incomplete imprint tangential to the
                          imprinted curve. Depending on the value of this
                          option, the imprint will be completed along the
                          direction of this plane until either:

                          o it meets any edge belonging to the target faces
                          o it meets any laminar edge belonging to the
                            target faces.

                          A completed imprint that self-intersects
                          will be trimmed at the point of self-intersection.

                          For more information, see <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-295712">here</A>.


<B>'tracking_type'</B>           Determines the format of the tracking records
                          that are returned when curves are imprinted.

                          There are two possible values for this option:
                            o <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_tracking_t.html>PK_imprint_tracking_basic_c</A> (default)
                            o <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_tracking_t.html>PK_imprint_tracking_curves_c</A>

                          For this function the information returned when
                          setting this option to <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_tracking_t.html>PK_imprint_tracking_basic_c</A>
                          is in the same format as pre V17.1.

                          The returned <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_track_r_t.html>PK_TOPOL_track_r_t</A> structure contains
                          tracking records of type PK_TOPOL_track_create_c
                          each of which contains the original face and the
                          imprinted edges on that face. When imprint
                          completion is performed additional information is
                          returned associated with edges imprinted to complete
                          imprints, tracking records are returned containing
                          the original topological element (face or edge)
                          upon which edges have been imprinted along with a
                          list of edges imprinted upon that element.

                          Setting the tracking_type option to
                          <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_tracking_t.html>PK_imprint_tracking_curves_c</A> returns information
                          that associates imprinted edges with both the
                          imprint curve from which they originate and the
                          original topology upon which they are imprinted.
                          The tracking information is returned by returning
                          a track record for each imprinted edge. Each edge
                          has two original_topols. The first of these is the
                          input curve which gave rise to this edge. The
                          second is the original topology on the body where
                          this edge is created. This is usually a face, but
                          where the edge is imprinted along a pre-existing
                          edge that edge is returned instead. Imprinted
                          curves arising from any requested imprint
                          completion are tracked by the same method, but the
                          original topology associated with the curve is
                          always null.


<B>'use_max_projection_dist'</B> If this is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_proj_dist_t.html>PK_imprint_proj_dist_whole_c</A>
                          then edges are only imprinted where the projection
                          of the curve upon a face lies wholly within
                          <B>'max_projection_dist'</B> of the curve causing the
                          imprint. The default behaviour when this field is
                          set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_proj_dist_t.html>PK_imprint_proj_dist_no_c</A> is to imprint all
                          curves regardless of the distance of the curve from
                          its projections upon the faces of the body. See
                          <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-295513">here</A> for more information.


<B>'max_projection_dist'</B>     If <B>'use_max_projection_dist'</B> is set to
                          <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_proj_dist_t.html>PK_imprint_proj_dist_whole_c</A> then edges are only
                          imprinted when the projected curve upon a face
                          lies wholly within this distance of the curve
                          causing the imprint. See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-295513">here</A> for more
                          information.
                          The default value is 0.0.


`imprint_coi_exactly`     If <B>'imprint_coi_exactly'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_true
                          then curves coincident with their target surfaces
                          are imprinted exactly where appropriate, rather
                          than being imprinted by projection.
                          See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-296271">here</A> for more information.
                          The default value is PK_LOGICAL_false.


`preferred_continuity`    Only <A HREF=../headers/pk_continuity_t.html>PK_continuity_g1_c</A> and <A HREF=../headers/pk_continuity_t.html>PK_continuity_c2_c</A>
                          are permitted. If <B>'preferred_continuity'</B> is set
                          to <A HREF=../headers/pk_continuity_t.html>PK_continuity_c2_c</A>, then projection curves
                          are fitted with c2 continuity when not exact.
                          It is also required that <B>'tracking_type'</B> be set
                          to <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_tracking_t.html>PK_imprint_tracking_curves_c</A> when using
                          <A HREF=../headers/pk_continuity_t.html>PK_continuity_c2_c</A>.
                          See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.052.html#50409836_pgfId-296299">here</A> for more information.
                          The default value is <A HREF=../headers/pk_continuity_t.html>PK_continuity_g1_c</A>.
