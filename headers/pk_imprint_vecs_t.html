A status value to be returned when imprinting vectors on a mesh.

It has the values:

    PK_imprint_vecs_success_c       The operation succeeded and there were no
                                    defects in the resultant mesh.
    PK_imprint_vecs_defects_c       The operation succeeded, but there were
                                    defects in the resultant mesh.
    PK_imprint_vecs_off_mesh_c      The operation did not imprint the vectors
                                    because some of them were not on the mesh.
                                    This status takes precedence over
                                    PK_imprint_vecs_bad_clusters_c.
    PK_imprint_vecs_bad_clusters_c  The operation did not imprint the vectors
                                    because there was a "cluster" of vectors
                                    which could not be resolved into a single
                                    vector.  See documentation for
                                    <A HREF=../headers/pk_mesh_imprint_vectors.html>PK_MESH_imprint_vectors</A>
                                    for a definition of a "cluster".
    PK_imprint_vecs_wrong_mtopol_c  The operation did not imprint the vectors
                                    because at least one of the given <B>'mtopols'</B>
                                    did not contain its corresponding vector.
                                    This status takes precedence over
                                    PK_imprint_vecs_off_mesh_c.
    PK_imprint_vecs_bad_parameter_c The operation did not imprint the vectors
                                    because at least one of the given UV
                                    parameters did not match its corresponding
                                    vector. This status takes precedence over
                                    PK_imprint_vecs_off_mesh_c.
