The option structure defines options applicable to finding defects in the mesh.
It includes the following fields:

    <B>'max_defects'</B>
        The maximum number of defects to be returned.
        If <B>'max_defects'</B> is zero (the default), no limit is set on the number
        of defects to be returned.

    <B>'have_tolerance'</B>
        Whether the parameter <B>'tolerance'</B> is supplied.

    <B>'tolerance'</B>
        If <B>'have_tolerance'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_true then the value of
        <B>'tolerance'</B> will be used for determining when points should be
        considered equal. The default accuracy will be the linear precision of
        the modeller.

    <B>'defect_tolerances'</B>
        A structure to specify different tolerances for different types
        of defects. If <B>'have_tolerance'</B> is set to PK_LOGICAL_true, this
        structure should not be specified.

    <B>'mtopol_find_defects'</B>
        Level of topological defect detection to be performed on the mesh.

    <B>'mfacet_find_defects'</B>
        Level of geometric defect detection to be performed on the mesh.

    <B>'mvertex_find_defects'</B>
        Level of defect detection to be performed on the mvertex normals of
        the mesh. These checks only apply to meshes with stored normals.

    <B>'mesh_find_self_ints'</B>
        Level of self intersection defect detection to be performed on
        the mesh.

    <B>'mesh_find_foldovers'</B>
        Level of foldover defect detection to be performed on the mesh.

    <B>'max_foldover_angle'</B>
        If <B>'mesh_find_foldovers'</B> is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_mesh_find_foldover_t.html>PK_MESH_find_foldover_all_c</A> then
        <B>'max_foldover_angle'</B> will be used for identifying foldovers. A fold
        is where the smaller of the two angles between two mfin-adjacent
        mfacets is less than or equal to <B>'max_foldover_angle'</B>. From this, a
        foldover is formed from chains of folded or laminar mfins which bound
        a region of facets whose normals are opposed to those of their
        neighbouring regions and which are within <B>'tolerance'</B> of those
        neighbours.

    <B>'mesh_find_disjoint'</B>
        Level of disjoint defect detection to be performed on the mesh.
