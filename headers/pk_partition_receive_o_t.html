Description of fields:


<B>'transmit_format'</B>        Format of the 'file'. Permitted values are

<B>'receive_user_fields'</B>    PK_LOGICAL_true if user fields are to be received


<B>'receive_deltas'</B>         Whether to receive no deltas, delay receiving deltas
                         until a later call to <A HREF=../headers/pk_partition_receive_deltas.html>PK_PARTITION_receive_deltas</A>, or
                         receive deltas with the partition.


<B>'receive_prev_version_deltas'</B>
                         Used to indicate that deltas transmitted from
                         earlier compatible versions of Parasolid may be
                         received. This field is ignored if <B>'receive_deltas'</B>
                         is set to PK_PARTITION_rcv_deltas_no_c


<B>'attdef_callback'</B>        Applications which intend to use this option should
                         contact Parasolid Technical Support for advice.


<B>'attdef_context'</B>         Context used to pass any application information to
                         <B>'attdef_callback'</B>.


<B>'attdef_callback_on'</B>     This option is ignored unless <B>'attdef_callback'</B> is
                         non-null.  Applications which intend to use this
                         option should contact Parasolid Technical Support
                         for advice.


<B>'deltas_block'</B>           Memory chain used by <A HREF=../headers/pk_partition_receive_b.html>PK_PARTITION_receive_b</A> when
                         <B>'receive_deltas'</B> is not PK_PARTITION_rcv_deltas_no_c,
                         otherwise ignored.


<B>'receive_all_attdefs'</B>    Whether to receive all attribute definitions or only
                         those used in the partition and/or its deltas.
                         This field is ignored unless <B>'receive_deltas'</B> is set
                         to PK_PARTITION_rcv_deltas_later_c.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.102.html#50409892_pgfId-295271">here</A> for more information.


<B>'allow_missing_deltas'</B>   Whether to receive a partition without its delta file
                         instead of failing with PK_ERROR_deltas_not_available.
                         This field is ignored unless <B>'receive_deltas'</B> is set
                         to PK_PARTITION_rcv_deltas_yes_c.
                         See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.102.html#50409892_pgfId-295271">here</A> for more information.


<B>'receive_compound'</B>       Controls receiving partition and delta files
                         containing compound bodies. Allowed values are:

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_compound_t.html>PK_receive_compound_split_c</A>:
                         Compound bodies in the partition are split into
                         individual bodies. This only has effect if
                         'receive_deltas' is set to
                         PK_PARTITION_rcv_deltas_no_c - otherwise the behaviour
                         is the same as with <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_compound_t.html>PK_receive_compound_fail_c</A>.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_compound_t.html>PK_receive_compound_keep_c</A>:
                         Receive compound bodies as they are.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_compound_t.html>PK_receive_compound_fail_c</A>:
                         Fail with PK_ERROR_compound_body if the file
                         contains compound bodies.

                         If any compound bodies have been split then a
                         report will be returned via the Parasolid Report
                         mechanism containing a record of <B>'type'</B>
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_record_type_t.html>PK_REPORT_record_type_3_c</A>.
                         This record will have a <B>'status'</B> of
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_3_t.html>PK_REPORT_3_compound_split_c</A> and will contain
                         information on the compound bodies that were
                         split when the file was received:
                         - <B>'n_int_arrays'</B> and <B>'n_item_arrays'</B>
                            the number of bodies received from the partition
                            file.
                         - <B>'int_arrays'</B>
                            for each body received from the partition file,
                            an array of child body identifiers if the body
                            was a compound body, otherwise an empty array.
                         - <B>'item_arrays'</B>
                            for each body received from the partition file,
                            an array of split bodies if the body was a
                            compound body, otherwise an array containing
                            just that body.


<B>'receive_using_seek'</B>     How any lazily received model data in the partition
                         are handled if they are not immediately needed.

                         If this option is <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_using_seek_t.html>PK_receive_using_seek_no_c</A> then
                         lazily received model data in the file will all be
                         read sequentially in the same Parasolid call.

                         If this option is <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_using_seek_t.html>PK_receive_using_seek_yes_c</A> then
                         only data needed for individual pieces of the model
                         will be received, which will be faster in many
                         scenarios and avoids unneeded model data taking up
                         internal memory.

                         To support <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_using_seek_t.html>PK_receive_using_seek_yes_c</A> for mesh
                         data, the partition file must have been transmitted
                         with the option <B>'transmit_meshes'</B> set to
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_meshes_t.html>PK_transmit_meshes_embedded_c</A> and the Frustrum
                         seek function <B>'ffskxt'</B> must be registered using
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_session_register_fru_2.html>PK_SESSION_register_fru_2</A>. If the partition file
                         was transmitted with <A HREF=../headers/pk_transmit_meshes_t.html>PK_transmit_meshes_separate_c</A>
                         then this option is ignored for mesh data.

                         This option is ignored for <A HREF=../headers/pk_partition_receive_b.html>PK_PARTITION_receive_b</A>.


<B>'receive_mixed'</B>          Controls receiving transmitted files that contain
                         parts with both facet and classic geometry.

                         If this option is set to the default
                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_mixed_t.html>PK_receive_mixed_fail_c</A> and the file contains mixed
                         parts, then receive will fail with
                         PK_ERROR_mixed_geometry.

                         To allow receiving mixed parts, this option should
                         be set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_mixed_t.html>PK_receive_mixed_allow_c</A>.

                         <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_mixed_t.html>PK_receive_mixed_make_facet_c</A> is for future
                         enhancement and will return
                         PK_ERROR_not_implemented.


<B>'receive_locked'</B>         Whether to lock the received partition to the calling
                         thread.

                         If this option is <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_locked_t.html>PK_receive_locked_auto_c</A>, then the
                         received partition is only locked if the calling
                         thread already had at least one partition locked.

                         If this option is <A HREF=../headers/pk_receive_locked_t.html>PK_receive_locked_always_c</A> and the
                         thread already had at least one partition locked,
                         then the received partition will also become locked
                         to this thread. If the thread did not have any
                         partitions locked, then the received partition will
                         become locked and will be the current and only usable
                         partition in the calling thread.
