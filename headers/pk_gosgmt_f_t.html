The arguments have the following significance :-


    segtyp: type of segment
    
    <B>'segtyp'</B> - the type of the segment; one of the following values
    
        SGTPED = 2006;   --- Edge
        SGTPSI = 2007;   --- Silhouette line
        SGTPPH = 2008;   --- Planar hatch-line

        When rendering a list of topological entities Parasolid may encounter a
        topology that it is unable to render (e.g. a rubber face). In such
        cases, Parasolid outputs an error segment (SGTPER), giving the tag of
        the bad entity and a code indicating why it was unable to render it.
        Parasolid then continues to render the remaining entities.
    
        If, during a call to <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_facet.html>PK_TOPOL_render_facet</A> or <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_volume.html>PK_TOPOL_render_volume</A>,
        either
          *  user tolerances can't be matched, or
          *  facets are created which self intersect or are severely creased,
        then geometric data is output as a segment type SGTPMF. In this case,
        the facets are always triangular.
    
        If Parasolid encounters unrenderable geometry when rendering a list of
        geometric entities (i.e. SGTPGC, SGTPGS and SGTPGB) this is ignored and
        no error segment is output.  Parasolid then continues to render the
        remaining entities.
    
        If edges/silhouettes/hatchlines/sharp-mfins are being output
        hierarchically then GOSGMT is called to output the whole geometry of
        the item (optional) and again to output the positions at which the
        visibility changes on the item (a visibility segment).
    
        When using the 3D viewport option in hidden line, auxiliary lines that
        arise from clipping to viewport boundaries may be output. Such lines
        will have segment type marked SGTPCL.
    
        When using the overlap option in hidden line, auxiliary lines that
        arise from face - face intersections may be output. Such lines
        will have segment type marked SGTPIC.
    
        When using the <B>'sharp_mfins'</B> option in <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_line_o_t.html>PK_TOPOL_render_line_o_t</A>, sharp
        mfins on meshes will be chained into polylines and may be output. Such
        polylines will have segment type SGTPSF.
    

    ntags, tags: tags associated with segment
    
    <B>'ntags'</B>, <B>'tags'</B> - an array of tags associated with the segment.
        The tags given depend upon the segment type as follows:
            SGTPED
                - tag of edge (or none if edge output hierarchically)
            SGTPSI, SGTPPH, SGTPRH, SGTPSF
                - tag of face on which silhouette, hatch, or sharp-mfin line
                  lies (or none if silhouette or hatchline output
                  hierarchically)
            SGTPPL
                - tag of face or surface on which the parametric hatch line
                  lies (or none if hatchline output hierarchically)
            SGTPRU, SGTPBB
                - tag of edge blended
            SGTPFT
                - tag of face on which facet lies (for facets generated under
                  <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_facet.html>PK_TOPOL_render_facet</A>)
            SGTPMF
                - tag of face on which mangled facet lies
            SGTPTS
                - tag of face on which facet strip lies
            SGTPGC
                - tag of the curve
            SGTPGS
                - tag of the surface
            SGTPGB
                - tag of the surface for which this is a boundary curve
            SGTPVT
                - none
            SGTPER
                - tag of entity which could not be rendered
            SGTPVP
                - none
            SGTPLB, SGTPLR
                - tag of frame or tag of lattice.  If the tag is a lattice the
                  ball or rod belongs to this lattice.  If the tag is a frame
                  the ball or rod belongs to this frame's lattice.
            SGTPVF
                - tag of the shell followed by tag of the face on which the
                  facet lies (for facets generated under
                  <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_volume.html>PK_TOPOL_render_volume</A>)
            SGTPVM
                - tag of the shell followed by tag of the face on which the
                  mangled facet lies (for facets generated under
                  <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_volume.html>PK_TOPOL_render_volume</A>)
    
        If edges, silhouettes, hatchlines or sharp-mfin lines are output
        hierarchically then the tag information is given by GOOPSG and GOCLSG.
    
        If regional data was requested in a call to <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_line.html>PK_TOPOL_render_line</A> two
        further tags are given for SGTPED and SGTPSI segments, identifying
        the faces either side of the line in the image. Either or both face
        tags may be null.
    
        If edge tags were requested in a call to <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_facet.html>PK_TOPOL_render_facet</A>, for
        each edge of the facet the tag of the model edge from which it was
        derived is given; or a null tag if it is not derived from a model
        edge. The number of edge tags given equals the number of vertices
        given in <B>'geom'</B>. The first edge tag ( tags[1] ) is the tag of
        the edge from which is derived the first facet edge (which ends at
        the first vertex given in geom). The second edge tag is for
        the facet edge which ends at the second vertex, and so on.
    
        If facet strips have been requested in a call to <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_render_facet.html>PK_TOPOL_render_facet</A>
        the format for the edges tags is as follows:-
    
             If the strip has n vertices, then there are
    
                2 * (n - 2) + 1 edge tags
    
             The i-th element of the tags array (starting at i = 1) is
             the tag of the edge between vertex,
    
                floor ( (i - 1) / 2 ) + 1
    
            and vertex,
    
                floor (i / 2) + 2
    
            where, floor (x) is the integer portion of x.
    

    ngeom, geom: geometry of segment
    
    <B>'ngeom'</B>, <B>'geom'</B> - an array of reals giving the geometry of the segment.
        The values given depend upon the type of the geometry, as specified in
        the second element of <B>'lntp'</B>.

                centre point, major axis direction, minor axis direction,
                major radius, minor radius
    
                The forward direction of the ellipse is clockwise when viewing
                the ellipse along the axis direction. The axis direction is
                the vector cross product of the major axis with the minor axis
                in that order.
    
            L3TPEL - elliptical arc: ngeom = 17

            L3TPRC - rational B-curve in Bezier form:
                <B>'geom'</B> holds <B>'ngeom'</B> vectors of dimension 4. These are the

                of dimension 3, which are the bspline vertices followed by
                lntp[10] reals which are the knots. So ngeom is equal to
                3 times lntp[9] plus lntp[10].

                are followed by lntp[10] reals which are the knots. So ngeom

            Note: Derivatives are never output for bodies or faces with facet
                  geometry, a segment of type L3TPFI will be returned rather

        If a facet has multiple loops the outer loop is output first and the
        inner loops follow. The vertices of the outer loop are ordered
        anticlockwise when viewed down the normal. The vertices of inner loops
        are ordered clockwise. Facets are manifold; i.e. no vertex coincides
        with any other in the same facet, nor does it lie in any edge in the
        same facet.
    
        For facet strips the vertices of the first facet in the strip are
        held in elements 0,1 and 2 of <B>'geom'</B> and are ordered anticlockwise when
        viewed down the normal. The vertices of the second facet are held in
        elements 1,2 and 3 and are ordered clockwise. The vertices of the n-th
        facet are held in elements n-1, n and n+1 and are ordered anticlockwise
        if n is odd and clockwise if n is even. If lntp[1] is L3TPTS then the
        number of facets in a strip is given by <B>'ngeom'</B> - 2. If lntp[1] is
        L3TPTN then the number of facet is given by <B>'ngeom'</B>/2 - 2.
    
        For visibility segments (SGTPVT/SGTPVP) geom contains the visibility
        transition points (i.e. vectors in model space at which the edge
        changes visibility). Segments of type SGTPVP contain parameters as
        well. If the edge has only one visibility then no geometry is output.
    
        The geometry array in an unparametrised (SGTPVT) visibility segment
        holds a sequence of sets of three doubles {x,y,z} corresponding to
        the vector position of the transition points in model space.
    
        The geometry array in a parametrised (SGTPVP) visibility segment
        holds a sequence of sets of four doubles {x,y,z,t} corresponding to

        the geometry segment.
