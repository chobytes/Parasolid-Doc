See also <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.065.html#50409851_pgfId-300966">Local Ops: Deleting Faces and Healing Wounds</A> for more
information.

All of the given faces, which must belong to the same body, are deleted from
that body.  If the resulting body does not have a complete boundary, then any
wounds are treated as wounds which are healed as specified by the
<B>'heal_action'</B> option.

If the faces belong to a general body, then they must form a manifold
set, and the boundaries of the faces should not be adjacent to
non-manifold vertices or edges.

The faces must not be all the faces in the body.

Rubber faces can not be grown to heal other wounds.

Tracking
If the delete has resulted in the original body being split into multiple
bodies, the resultant bodies will be returned as product topologies of the
original body in the <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_track_r_t.html>PK_TOPOL_track_r_t</A> structure.
This can only happen if the <B>'allow_disjoint'</B> option is set to PK_LOGICAL_false.

If the <B>'heal_action'</B> option is set to PK_FACE_heal_no_c, and <B>'track'</B> option
is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_delete_track_t.html>PK_delete_track_rubber_c</A>, each rubber face that is created will
generate a tracking record of type PK_TOPOL_track_create_c consisting of the
tags of the original faces and the new rubber face. Similarly, if the
<B>'heal_action'</B> option is set to PK_FACE_heal_cap_c, and <B>'track'</B> option is set
to <A HREF=../headers/pk_delete_track_t.html>PK_delete_track_cap_c</A>, each capping face that is created will generate a
tracking record of type PK_TOPOL_track_create_c consisting of the tags of the
original faces and the new capping face.
