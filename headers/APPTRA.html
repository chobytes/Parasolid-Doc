APPTRA ( entity, transf, ifail )
================================

  Apply transformation

Receives:
  KI_tag_list_entity       *entity         --- entity or list of entities
  KI_tag_transform         *transf         --- transformation to apply

Returns:
  KI_cod_error             *ifail          --- failure code

Specific errors:
  KI_is_attached            geometric entity is attached to topology
  KI_bad_sharing            sharing prevents transformation
  KI_wrong_transf           invalid transformation
                            unsuitable entity for transformation
  KI_different_types        entities in list are not all of same type
  KI_wrong_entity_in_list   list contains entity of wrong type

Description:
  Applies a transformation to an entity or list of entities. The types of
  entity permitted are:

      Assembly
      Instance
      Body
      Point
      Curve
      Surface
      Transformation

  If the transformation is non-orthogonal (see CRETFM) it can only be applied to
  the following entities:

      B-surface
      B-curve
      foreign surface
      foreign curve
      SP curve on B-surface or foreign surface
      line
      trimmed curve of the above
      point
      transform
      body containing only the above

  If a list of entities is given all the entities in the list must be of the
  same type.

  The specified transformation is applied to the entity or entities as follows:

  Assembly:
    The transformation is applied to any instances and construction geometry
    in the assembly.

  Instance:
    If the instance does not have a transformation attached a copy of the given
    transformation is attached to the instance. Otherwise, the transformation
    is applied to the transformation attached to the instance (see below).

  Body:
    The transformation is applied to all geometric entities in the body.

  Point:
    The transformation is applied to the point. The point must not be attached
    to a vertex.

  Curve:
    The transformation is applied to the curve. If the curve is an intersection
    curve its underlying surfaces are also transformed. The curve must not be
    attached to an edge (nor must any of its dependents be attached to any
    topology). Furthermore neither the curve nor any of its dependents may be
    shared with another geometric entity which is not a member of the list of
    entities being transformed.

  Surface:
    The transformation is applied to the surface. Any dependent curves and
    sufaces are also transformed. The surface must not be attached to a face
    (nor its dependents, if present, to faces or edges.) Furthermore neither
    the surface nor any of its dependents may be shared with another geometric
    entity which is not a member of the list of entities being transformed.

  Transformations:
    The two transformations are multiplied. If A and B are transformations,
    the result of applying A to B is a transformation which applies B and
    then A. The transformation being altered must not be attached to an
    instance.

  Note - Only rotation and translation transformations can be applied to
  assemblies or instances.
