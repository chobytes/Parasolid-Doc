The PK_FACE_make_blend_o_t contains the following options:



                        Trimming Options.

 <B>'trim'</B>  Indicates how the blend is to be trimmed. See documentation of
         <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_trim_t.html>PK_blend_trim_t</A>. The default is <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_trim_t.html>PK_blend_trim_to_walls_c</A>.

 <B>'walls'</B> Determines if and how the blend sheets are attached to the defining
         walls. See documentation of <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_walls_t.html>PK_blend_walls_t</A>. The default is
         <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_walls_t.html>PK_blend_walls_attach_c</A>.

If either of the walls defining the blend is from a solid body, and <B>'walls'</B>
is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_walls_t.html>PK_blend_walls_attach_c</A>, then <B>'trim'</B> must be either
<A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_trim_t.html>PK_blend_trim_short_c</A> or <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_trim_t.html>PK_blend_trim_to_walls_c</A>, and the blend must not be
wire-face.

For wire-face blends <B>'trim'</B> must be <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_trim_t.html>PK_blend_trim_short_c</A> and <B>'walls'</B> must
be either <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_walls_t.html>PK_blend_walls_trim_no_c</A>, <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_walls_t.html>PK_blend_walls_preview_c</A> or
<A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_walls_t.html>PK_blend_walls_attach_c</A>.

If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the call to <A HREF=../headers/pk_face_make_blend.html>PK_FACE_make_blend</A>
will return the fault code <A HREF=../headers/pk_fxf_fault_t.html>PK_fxf_fault_inconsistent_c</A>.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-306185">Trimming face-face blends</A> for more information.



                        Blend Shape Options:

See <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_shape_t.html>PK_blend_shape_t</A> for details of the controls used to define the shape
of the blend.


                        Blend Constraint Options:

 <B>'cliff_edges'</B>    Blend is constrained by cliff edges.
                  An array of edge tags is given.
                  The blend will be constrained to be cliffedge blend in the
                  region of the given edges.

 <B>'tangent_edges'</B>  Blend is constrained by tangent hold lines.
                  An array of edge tags is given.
                  The blend will be constrained to be a tangent
                  hold line blend in the region of the given edges.
                  For constant and variable radius rolling ball or disc blends
                  the blend need not be constrained by these edges. If the
                  blend is a variable radius rolling ball or disc blend, the
                  left and right ranges of the law curve must be equal.

 <B>'conic_edges'</B>    Blend is constrained by conic hold lines.
                  An array of edge tags is given.
                  The blend will be constrained to be a conic hold line
                  blend in the region of the given edges.
                  For constant and variable radius rolling ball blends
                  blend need not be constrained by these edges.  If the
                  blend is a curvature continuous blend then <B>'cliff_edges'</B>
                  and <B>'tangent_edges'</B> must not be set, and the number of edge
                  tags in the array must be at least two.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-303843">Constraining a blend locally using blend size</A> for more
information.

 <B>'inv_tangent_edges'</B>
                  Blend is constrained by inverted tangent hold lines.
                  An array of edge tags is given.
                  The blend will be constrained to be a tangent
                  hold line blend in the region of the given edges.
                  For constant and variable radius rolling ball or disc blends
                  the blend need not be constrained by these edges. If the
                  blend is a variable radius rolling ball or disc blend, the
                  left and right ranges of the law curve must be equal.

 <B>'inv_conic_edges'</B>
                  Blend is constrained by inverted conic hold lines.
                  An array of edge tags is given.
                  The blend will be constrained to be a conic hold line
                  blend in the region of the given edges.
                  For constant and variable radius rolling ball blends
                  blend need not be constrained by these edges.  If the
                  blend is a curvature continuous blend then <B>'cliff_edges'</B>
                  and <B>'tangent_edges'</B> must not be set, and the number of edge
                  tags in the array must be at least two.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-304248">Inverting cliffedges and holdlines</A> for more information.

 <B>'limit_1'</B>
 <B>'limit_2'</B>        Limit Planes.
                  One or two planes may be specified.
                  The blend will be trimmed to end in a constant parameter
                  line determined by a plane. The blend will lie on the
                  positive side of the plane.

See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-307164">Trimming blend to a plane</A> for more information.

For a wire-face blend all edges in <B>'cliff_edges'</B> must be from the wire body.
<B>'tangent_edges'</B>, <B>'conic_edges'</B>, <B>'inv_tangent_edges'</B> and <B>'inv_conic_edges'</B>
must not be supplied.



                        Blend Rib Controls.

 <B>'output_rib'</B>       Control how ribs are produced.
                    This token controls under what circumstances face-face
                    blending will produce ribs.  The default is to not
                    output ribs.

 <B>'group_rib'</B>        Control how to group the ribs produced.
                    Grouping controls how the limit on the number of ribs
                    is applied.  This token defines whether the ribs are
                    grouped by blend face, or by the intervals along the
                    <B>'parameter'</B> curve defined by <B>'interval_parms'</B>,
                    or not at all (default).

 <B>'max_n_ribs'</B>       Limit on number of ribs produced per group.
                    The number of ribs produced in each group will be no
                    greater than this number. The default value is zero,
                    for which no ribs will be produced.

 <B>'n_interval_parms'</B> Number of <B>'interval_parms'</B> supplied.
                    Default is zero.

 <B>'interval_parms'</B>   Interval parameters.
                    These are used to divide the <B>'parameter'</B> curve into
                    intervals for grouping ribs.  They should have values
                    in the parameter range of the curve.

For wire-face blends these options must be left at their default value.

                        Control Options.

 <B>'tolerance'</B>       A tolerance is associated with this blend.

 <B>'have_help_point'</B> Whether a help point is provided

 <B>'help_point'</B>      Help point provided.
                   A vector, which will be used to differentiate between
                   multiple alternative possible blends between the walls.
                   If there is a blend which passes
                   close to the help point, it will be the one created.
                   The <B>'help_point'</B> can be used in conjunction with
                   the <B>'output_rib'</B> field of the <B>'rib_control'</B> structure to
                   request that a rib is returned at the vector
                   provided in <B>'help_point'</B>.

 <B>'multiple'</B>        Create multiple blends sheets.
                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_face_make_blend.html>PK_FACE_make_blend</A> will only create one blend unless
                   this option is set to PK_LOGICAL_true.

                   information.

 <B>'propagate'</B>       Propagate blends.
                   If this token is given the blends will be allowed
                   to propagate past smooth edges beyond the provided walls.

                   See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-822507">Propagating blends</A> for more information.

 <B>'notch'</B>           End Overflow
                   If this options is set to PK_LOGICAL_true the blend will
                   be allowed to extend past notches, whether in the middle
                   or at the end of the blend.

                   See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-310222">Blend notches</A> for more information.

 <B>'local_check'</B>     If this option is set to <B>'PK_LOGICAL_true'</B>, then
                   <B>'checks'</B> will be ignored, and the level of local checking
                   will be:

                        Surface self-intersection checks on all surfaces
                        except B-surfaces will be performed
                        Face checks will be performed
                        Face-face inconsistency checks will be perfomed.

                   If this option is set to <B>'PK_LOGICAL_false'</B>,
                   then the amount of local checking will
                   be determined by <B>'checks'</B>.

 <B>'checks'</B>          Controls the amount of checking required. Ignored unless
                   <B>'local_check'</B> is set to <B>'PK_LOGICAL_false'</B>. The faces of all
                   self-intersecting surfaces requested for detection are
                   returned in a report of type <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_1_t.html>PK_REPORT_1_blend_faces_sx_c</A>.

                   See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-311555">Checking face-face blends</A> for more
                   information.

 <B>'update'</B>          This option allows the disabling of some changes to the
                   blending algorithms for rebuild purposes.

                   See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-304976">Options</A> for more information.

 <B>'user_surface'</B>    This option allows users to users to supply a blend surface
                   to the face-face blending algorithm. The surface must be
                   within tolerance of the faces being blended. Parasolid
                   will attempt to use a given surface as a blend surface even
                   if this appears to be inconsistent with the <B>'left_sense'</B> and
                   `right sense' arguments.

                   See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-312908">User-supplied surfaces</A> for more information.

 <B>'repair_su_X'</B>     This option controls whether or not Parasolid will attempt
                   to repair blend surfaces that are self-intersecting. It
                   only has an effect on constant radius rolling ball blends.
                   Parasolid will create suitable faces to patch the
                   self-intersecting regions. This option will only attempt to
                   repair blends that are self-intersecting due to an
                   underlying surface of the blend being too tightly curved to
                   support the blend if the <B>'inside_tight'</B> option is set to
                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_inside_tight_t.html>PK_blend_inside_tight_faces_c</A> or
                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_inside_tight_t.html>PK_blend_inside_tight_partial_c</A>

                   If 'repair_su_X' is set to any value other than
                   '<A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_repair_su_x_t.html>PK_blend_repair_su_x_no_c</A>', then the faces of all
                   self-intersecting surfaces that could not be repaired are
                   returned in a report of type <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_1_t.html>PK_REPORT_1_blend_faces_sx_c</A>.

                   See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-311603">Repairing self-intersecting blends</A> for more
                   information.

 <B>'inside_tight'</B>    This option controls whether blends will be created on
                   the inside of faces that have a smaller radius of
                   curvature than the blend being created. Switching
                   this option on also enables blends on the inside of
                   cliff-edges that are more tightly curved than the
                   blend radius.

                   This option may only be used with constant or
                   variable radius rolling ball blends without conic
                   or tangent edges.  In the variable radius case the
                   option must be either <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_inside_tight_t.html>PK_blend_inside_tight_no_c</A> or
                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_inside_tight_t.html>PK_blend_inside_tight_blends_c</A>.

                   This option may also only be used for blends with conic
                   or g2 cross-section shape; it may not be used for blends
                   with chamfer  cross-section shape.

                   The values <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_inside_tight_t.html>PK_blend_inside_tight_faces_c</A> or
                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_inside_tight_t.html>PK_blend_inside_tight_partial_c</A> may only be supplied if the
                   <B>'repair_su_X'</B> option is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_repair_su_x_t.html>PK_blend_repair_su_X_yes_c</A>
                   or <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_repair_su_x_t.html>PK_blend_repair_su_X_report_c</A>.  In the latter case any
                   blend faces created on too tightly curved faces will be
                   returned as repaired.
                   See <A HREF="../chapters/fd_chap.079.html#50409866_pgfId-312206">here</A> for more information.

 <B>'have_propagation_angle'</B>
                   If this option is set to PK_LOGICAL_true then a
                   <B>'propagation_angle'</B> has been provided and this will be used
                   to control propagation past sharp edges.

 <B>'propagation_angle'</B>
                   The maximal angle in radians at which propagation past sharp
                   edges is allowed.
                   It is used whenever <B>'have_propagation_angle'</B> is set to
                   PK_LOGICAL_true.

 <B>'repair_fa_X'</B>     This option controls whether or not Parasolid will attempt
                   to repair blend faces that are self-intersecting.

 <B>'partition'</B>       An optional user-supplied partition. If a partition is
                   supplied and the blend options specify the blend result
                   is to be returned as sheets, rather than attached to the
                   left-hand body being blended, then those resultant
                   sheets will be placed within this user-supplied partition.
                   If any ribs are requested via the <B>'rib_control'</B> structure
                   they will also be placed in the user-supplied
                   partition.
                   Default behaviour assumes no partition supplied
                   ( PK_PARTITION_null ) and any resultant sheets or ribs are
                   placed in the partition associated with the left-hand
                   body being blended.

 <B>'prevent_sharp'</B>   This option controls whether Parasolid will attempt to
                   prevent sharp edges between blend faces.  These can occur
                   for variable radius blends when passing a G2 discontinuity
                   in the faces that are being blended, or when the radius
                   definition of a blend changes sharply e.g. when a blend
                   becomes constrained by a tangent holdline.

                   This option may only be changed from its default value
                   ( <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_prevent_sharp_t.html>PK_blend_prevent_sharp_no_c</A> ) if the following are all
                   satisified by the blend:
                    - it is a rolling-ball blend with a circular or G2
                      ( <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_xs_shape_t.html>PK_blend_xs_shape_g2_c</A> ) cross-section shape; AND
                    - it has a constant radius, variable radius, constant
                      width, variable width or a tangent holdline; AND
                    - it is without conic holdline edges.

  <B>'track_edges'</B>
                   Whether to provide additional tracking information
                   associated with laminar edges when the blend result is a
                   sheet body. The default provides no tracking associated
                   with the laminar edges ( <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_track_edges_t.html>PK_blend_track_edges_no_c</A> ).
                   Setting this option to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_track_edges_t.html>PK_blend_track_edges_laminar_c</A>
                   will request additional tracking information. This
                   additional information will be returned within the return
                   structure and will usually describe the underlying
                   coincident edge and/or face upon the original body.

   <B>'improve_tolerance'</B>
                   Whether to use new, improved tolerance handling
                   which reduces the tolerance of the newly created
                   edges. The default provides the old behaviour
                   ( <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_tolerance_t.html>PK_blend_tolerance_standard_c</A> ).
                   To get the new behaviour use
                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_tolerance_t.html>PK_blend_tolerance_improved_c</A>.

   <B>'run_out'</B>
                   Whether to stop the blend when the angle subtended by the
                   blend is equal to the specified <B>'run_out_angle'</B>.
                   Should not be used together with wire-face blends, ribs or
                   user_surface.
                   ( <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_run_out_t.html>PK_blend_run_out_no_c</A> ).

   <B>'run_out_angle'</B>
                   The angle in radians to be used if <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_run_out_t.html>PK_blend_run_out_angle_c</A>
                   is specified. The default value is 0.1.
                   The angle must be greater then 0 and less then pi.

    <B>'report'</B>
                   Whether to report any repaired blend faces in the
                   Parasolid report stream. Any records will be of type
                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_record_type_t.html>PK_REPORT_record_type_1_c</A> and will have a status of
                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_1_t.html>PK_REPORT_1_rep_sx_faces_c</A> or <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_1_t.html>PK_REPORT_1_rep_G2_faces_c</A>.
                   In the first case the report will list those blend faces
                   created by repairing self-intersections.
                   In the second, the blend_faces reported are those from
                   G2 blends which have been modified to preserve continuity
                   when crossing G2-discontinuous edges.
                   ( <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_report_repaired_t.html>PK_blend_report_repaired_no_c</A> )

   <B>'extension_shape'</B>
                   This option controls how underlying surfaces of faces and
                   curves of certain edges are extended for G2 blends. If the
                   surfaces/curves are extended linearly, then blends built on
                   the extension may have a C1 discontinuity on the boundary.
                   Setting this option to <A HREF=../headers/pk_extension_shape_t.html>PK_extension_shape_soft_c</A> avoids
                   this, but may require surfaces of faces to be extended as a
                   result. Any edges given in <B>'constraints'</B> that bound one of
                   these faces may also need their curves softly extended.

                   The surfaces/curves whose soft extension was used to
                   construct the blend, as well as whether they have been
                   permanently extended, will be reported in a
                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_3_t.html>PK_REPORT_3_geom_extended_c</A> report. Any surfaces/curves that
                   could not be extended or already contains discontinuities
                   will also be reported in a <A HREF=../headers/pk_report_3_t.html>PK_REPORT_3_blend_x_g1_c</A> report.
                   This option may only be set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_extension_shape_t.html>PK_extension_shape_soft_c</A>
                   if <B>'xs_shape'</B> in <B>'shape'</B> is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_xs_shape_t.html>PK_blend_xs_shape_g2_c</A>,
                   or the blend is a non-circular conic blend.

                   A non-circular conic blend can be achieved by setting
                   <B>'xs_shape'</B> in <B>'shape'</B> to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_xs_shape_t.html>PK_blend_xs_shape_conic_c</A> and
                   by setting either:
                   - <B>'rho_const'</B> in <B>'shape'</B>
                   - <B>'rho'</B> in <B>'shape'</B>
                   -  an unequal <B>'range1_const'</B> and <B>'range2_const'</B> in <B>'shape'</B>
                   - <B>'range1'</B> and <B>'range2'</B> in <B>'shape'</B> with different
                      law curves
                   -  or by providing conic holdlines in both walls and
                      ensuring that the blend contact points are defined only
                      by the holdlines. This can be done by not setting any of
                      the radius or range options in <B>'shape'</B>.

                   ( <A HREF=../headers/pk_extension_shape_t.html>PK_extension_shape_linear_c</A> )

   <B>'master_faces'</B>
                   This option controls whether to use master faces.

                   If the value of the option is the default
                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_use_master_faces_t.html>PK_blend_use_master_faces_yes_c</A> then only those blends are
                   created where the blend goes through the first
                   face of either wall (master face).

                   If the option is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_use_master_faces_t.html>PK_blend_use_master_faces_no_c</A>
                   then all blends which pass through any pair of faces
                   from the left wall and right wall are considered.
                   In this case if <B>'multiple'</B> is PK_LOGICAL_true then
                   <B>'have_help_point'</B> must be PK_LOGICAL_false and all the
                   blends will be created. If <B>'multiple'</B> is PK_LOGICAL_false
                   then <B>'have_help_point'</B> must be PK_LOGICAL_true and only
                   the blend closest to the help point will be created.

                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_blend_use_master_faces_t.html>PK_blend_use_master_faces_no_c</A> is implemented only for
                   constant radius rolling ball blends without cliff and
                   holdline edges.

    <B>'imprint_complete'</B>
                   When the blend is trimmed so that, on one side, the blend
                   meets a laminar edge ( usually via the 'trim' option or
                   stopping topology ) this option can be used to control how
                   to complete the blend boundary on the longer face. The
                   completed edges are used to trim off excess material. This
                   option can only be used if set to either the default or
                   <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_laminar_c</A> - the other values are not
                   implemented in blending. If one or more of the bodies being
                   blended are solid bodies, <A HREF=../headers/pk_fxf_fault_t.html>PK_fxf_fault_inconsistent_c</A>
                   will be returned.
                  ( <A HREF=../headers/pk_imprint_complete_t.html>PK_imprint_complete_no_c</A> )
