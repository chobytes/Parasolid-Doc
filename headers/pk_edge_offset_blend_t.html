This datatype is used to select advanced offset with blends.

The effect of advanced offset with blends is to replace the offset edge which
would have otherwise resulted with a blended face of uniform radius, subject
to the following requirements.

* The edge lies between two non-rubber faces.
* The offset distances applied to the two faces are equal in magnitude, the
  resulting blend will have radius equal to this value.
* The faces are both offset to the same side of their original positions.
* The 'convexity' of the original edge satisfies the convexity indicated
  by the option value. Edges of mixed convexity are not suitable for blending
  with this option except in the case where an otherwise convex or concave
  edge is smooth at one or both of its ends.
* Further requirements specific to any function offering this option will be
  documented with that function.

For the purpose of this option 'convexity' refers to the 'visual' convexity
of the original edge when viewed from the side of the original faces on
which the offset faces lie. There is no direct dependence on face normal
direction but an indirect dependence in that the 'side' of the original face
on which an offset face lies depends on face normal direction and the
sign of the offset distance applied to that face.

It has the values:

    PK_EDGE_offset_blend_no_c:       Offset edges are not blended.

    PK_EDGE_offset_blend_convex_c:   The effect of the operation is to blend
                                     the offset edge which would otherwise
                                     have resulted - convex edges only.

This option results in "class migration". The class of the modified
topology is not necessarily the same as the class of the original topology
from which it was derived. This means that failing entities reported in
<A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_local_r_t.html>PK_TOPOL_local_r_t</A> may not be of the class typical for the status value.
See documentation in <A HREF=../headers/pk_topol_local_r_t.html>PK_TOPOL_local_r_t</A> for further details.
