This datatype is used to control how blend walls are trimmed back to
blend faces in both face-face blends and three-face blends. It has the values:

    PK_blend_walls_trim_no_c  Do not trim walls.
                              The walls will not be trimmed.
                              The blend will not be attached to the walls
                              but will be created as a separate
                              sheet body.

    PK_blend_walls_trim_both_c Trim the side walls. These side walls will
                              be trimmed by the  blend boundaries.
                              The blend will not be attached to any wall
                              but will be created as a separate
                              sheet body. This token is only valid if the
                              side walls for the blend are from different
                              bodies. Note that in the case of three-face
                              blends the centre wall is either left untouched
                              or completely removed after the operation.

    PK_blend_walls_attach_c   Trim the side walls and attach blend. Only the
                              side walls will be trimmed by the blend.
                              The blend will be attached to the side walls.
                              If the side walls lie in different bodies the
                              bodies will be combined, with the body
                              containing the left wall being considered as the
                              target body. If <B>'left_sense'</B> and <B>'right_sense'</B>
                              are not the same, the body containing the
                              right wall will be negated in order to produce
                              a consistent result.
                              (default)

    PK_blend_walls_solid_c    Trim the side walls, attach blend and make solid.
                              As for PK_blend_walls_attach_c, with the
                              addition that if the result of the blending
                              operation encloses a volume then a solid
                              body will be created. Otherwise a sheet body
                              will be returned.

    PK_blend_walls_preview_c  Do not trim walls.
                              The walls will not be trimmed.
                              The blend will not be attached to the walls
                              but will be created as a separate
                              sheet body.
                              This separate sheet body will only be
                              returned if it could have been attached if
                              <B>'walls'</B> were set to PK_blend_walls_attach_c.
