This structure contains:


 Geometry creation controls

<B>'have_angular_tolerance'</B>  : This field controls whether the associated
                            <B>'angular_tolerance'</B> is used.

<B>'angular_tolerance'</B>       : If <B>'have_angular_tolerance'</B> is PK_LOGICAL_true
                            and this field is set to a positive value
                            then this value is used to control the sum
                            of the angles formed between a facet edge
                            and the curve/surface tangents at each end.
                            In particular, facets for classic surfaces
                            will usually be created in such a way that the
                            surface normals corresponding to points in a
                            portion of surface represented by the same
                            facet will not differ by more than this value.
                            This rule is usually observed, but this is not
                            guaranteed.

<B>'have_max_chord_length'</B>   : This field controls whether the associated
                            <B>'max_chord_length'</B> is used.

<B>'max_chord_length'</B>        : If <B>'have_max_chord_length'</B> is PK_LOGICAL_true
                            and this field is set to a positive value
                            then this value is used to control the chord
                            length of all polylines created for edges and
                            halfedges. This value may also influence the
                            size and aspect ratio of facets near the
                            boundaries of new meshes.

<B>'have_max_facet_width'</B>    : This field controls whether the associated
                            <B>'max_facet_width'</B> is used.

<B>'max_facet_width'</B>         : If <B>'have_max_facet_width'</B> is PK_LOGICAL_true
                            and this field is set to a positive value then this
                            value is used to control the maximum length of
                            the mfins in the meshes created for any supplied
                            faces. It does not provide any control over the
                            widths of facets in faces with existing facet
                            geometry unless these are explicitly handed in
                            for conversion.

<B>'store_normals'</B>           : If this field is PK_LOGICAL_true then the
                            meshes created for any supplied faces will
                            inherit normals from the existing surfaces
                            on these faces. When this field is
                            PK_LOGICAL_true, the meshes created for faces
                            which initially have classic geometry will have
                            unique stored mvertex normals consistent with
                            the geometry of the original surfaces. If the
                            input array contains faces with facet geometry
                            which do not need subdividing, the new meshes
                            for these faces will be the same as the original
                            meshes would be after calling
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_mesh_store_normals.html>PK_MESH_store_normals</A> with the <B>'replace'</B> field
                            in the option structure set to
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_mesh_replace_normal_t.html>PK_MESH_replace_normal_all_c</A>.

                            Note: mfins whose mvertices correspond to points
                            on the existing surfaces for which
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_surf_eval_with_normal.html>PK_SURF_eval_with_normal</A> returns an error
                            code different from PK_ERROR_no_errors will
                            still all share a single normal, but this will be
                            calculated using the local geometry of the new
                            meshes, rather than that of the classic surfaces
                            they replace.

 Tracking controls

<B>'track_faces'</B>             : If this field is PK_LOGICAL_true then tracking
                            records will be returned for all topological
                            changes to faces made as part of the conversion
                            operation.

<B>'track_edges'</B>             : If this field is set to <A HREF=../headers/pk_track_edges_t.html>PK_track_edges_yes_c</A> or
                            <A HREF=../headers/pk_track_edges_t.html>PK_track_edges_laminar_wire_c</A> then tracking
                            records will be returned for all topological
                            changes mades to edges of the indicated type.

<B>'return_redundant'</B>        : If this field is PK_LOGICAL_true then tracking
                            records will be returned containing all
                            topological entities which were merged out or
                            made redundant by the conversion operation.

<B>'return_modified'</B>         : If this field is PK_LOGICAL_true then an array
                            will be returned containing all topological
                            entities which were in any way modified by the
                            conversion operation. This will include any
                            entities which have had their geometry replaced,
                            any edges and vertices which have undergone
                            tolerance adjustments, as well as any newly
                            created edges and vertices.
